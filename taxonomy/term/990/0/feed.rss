&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;photo / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meowpoww.com&quot;&gt;Gin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; That&amp;#8217;s how we became the Haunting Oboe Music bunch&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s an unnerving silence to the vaulted hallways of the UT music building that makes me feel unwelcome. The feeling is not completely unreasonable; I&amp;#8217;m interviewing a band who is literally forcing itself to push the limits of its own creativity here, in the building that stands as a beacon for the time-honored standards of musical traditions. So we keep our voices hushed in hopes that our talk of experimental rock music won&amp;#8217;t be overheard by the spirits of Haydn or Beethoven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunting Oboe Music has put before itself a challenge of almost unthinkable proportions. It&amp;#8217;s simple enough in its construction &amp;#8212; 12 months, 12 EPs; one for each month, one for each letter in the first two words of its name. The idea came from the Brooklyn indie band Bishop Allen who did the same thing back in 2008. Haunting Oboe Music&amp;#8217;s lead singer George (it&amp;#8217;s first names only with these guys) had heard about Bishop Allen&amp;#8217;s project and brought it to the band. &amp;#8220;We looked at it as having two benefits,&amp;#8221; says Jared, one of the band&amp;#8217;s drummers, about the initial idea, &amp;#8220;one, getting lots of press, getting our name out there as much as possible, and two, forcing ourselves to write a lot of stuff.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thatotherpaper.com/austin/monthly_hauntings&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Emo&#039;s slayed by The Sword</title>
 <link>http://thatotherpaper.com/blog/john_michael_cassetta/emos_slayed_by_the_sw_0</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While I intended to catch Austin&amp;#8217;s response to Metal, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swordofdoom.com&quot;&gt;The Sword&lt;/a&gt;, play at Emo&amp;#8217;s last night, I &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; missed the show! I did see an interesting review in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Dose&lt;/em&gt; this morning though:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Zookeeper: Makin&#039; music with friends</title>
 <link>http://thatotherpaper.com/austin/zookeeper_makin_music_with_friends</link>
 <description>

&lt;p&gt;Zookeeper&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Becoming All Things&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of songs written by Austinite Chris Simpson (formerly of The Gloria Record, Mineral) and performed with everyone he knows. In many ways, this sense of camaraderie, arguably the best part of “makin’ music,” is felt throughout the album. “Snow In Berlin,” the album&amp;#8217;s opener, romps and rolls with a loose collection of every rock instrument you can imagine: a few guitars, a piano or two, a couple of organs, a set of horns, and Simpson’s heartfelt vocals to top it all off. The mix is dense, and sometimes the instruments seem to forget they’re part of a bigger ensemble. Generally speaking though, that’s what gathering your friends up for a jam session is all about, and I speak from a long history of “let’s-start-a-band” bands.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hello, Avalanche</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/austin/reviews/hello_avalanche&quot; title=&quot;Hello, Avalanche&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;floatright&quot; src=&quot;/files/avalanche_thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hello, Avalanche&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where conformity is the norm and the musical recipe for success is “reduce, reuse and recycle,” why is The Octopus Project garnering the attention of the mainstream public? And why does that girl I used to know (whose Facebook I occasionally stalk) like both Fall Out Boy and The Octopus Project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thatotherpaper.com/austin/reviews/hello_avalanche&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
