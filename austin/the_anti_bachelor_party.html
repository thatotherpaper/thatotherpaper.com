      <p>As someone who spends a lot of time drinking on Sixth Street, I&#8217;m well aware of how many people are getting married. It seems like every time I walk into a bar, I see yet another bimbo in a wedding veil slurping martinis through a penis straw &#8211; which is the perfect way to shout to the world that she’s ready for the most serious commitment of her life.</p>

<div class="image floatright" style="width: 280px;">

<div class="caption">&nbsp;</div>
</div>


<p>These constant marriage reminders &#8211; coupled with an ever-increasing number of friends who are getting married &#8211; can make proud bachelors like me think everyone is getting married. It’s as if I&#8217;m the last guy at the Alamo standing alone against the tyranny of marriage. Like Davy Crockett, I look up, waiting for the moment an army of brides could breach the walls of my fortress of freedom, hurling bouquets or garters or whatever the hell else people throw at weddings.</p>

<p>Recently some of my single friends decided to take a stand of our own. We would go all-out celebrating our single life to commemorate a truly momentous occasion: My best friend Will had called off his wedding. Yes, he was returning to the single life, and it called for a celebration. So we decided to throw an anti-bachelor party on the day he would have gotten married.</p>

<p>Before you think I&#8217;m some bitter Dating Reject who likes to spew venom on people in love, let me first say Will had made a horrendous mistake. In January 2006 we went to the Rose Bowl, and he met this girl out there.  Just like a modern-day Romeo and Juliet, their great love story began with a drunken hook-up in a bathroom on New Year’s Eve.  She tagged along to a few bars during that week and they exchanged numbers. They then did the long-distance-dating thing for about nine months.</p>

<p>After seeing Will in person fewer than 30 times, she decided to move to Dallas in order to &#8220;give the relationship a chance.” (Those were her words, but for those of you who do not speak Two-Faced Conniving Witch, let me translate: “I am going to move to Dallas and make you feel guilty every day until I have a ring on my finger.”) Two weeks later, they were engaged.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that they didn&#8217;t really get along &#8211; especially since she was crazy. I kept telling my friend that, but he didn&#8217;t believe me until he came to Austin with her a few months ago. After what we all thought was a great evening, she instantly got into one of her crazy moods, took off back to their hotel, and got the man at the desk to change the locks so Will’s key wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>So myself and several others went to Dallas to celebrate both Will’s full pardon from married life and our own freedom. But what do you do for a party that&#8217;s the <em>opposite</em> of a bachelor party? Are we supposed to make sure the anti-bachelor doesn’t pass out drunk before midnight? Do we hire a stripper and pay her to put clothes back on?</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t know for sure, but we decided just to be safe we should start out at a strip club anyway. Since it was Friday, and we went in the late afternoon, we witnessed a unique scene. First of all, the daytime shift is not the same as the evening. Imagine the difference between a BMW and a Geo Metro. Both cars will get you where you want to go, but I promise you will be more embarrassed if your friends see you in the Metro.</p>

<p>Now most people who are not on vacation from work have jobs and things to do at 3:30<span class="smallcaps">pm</span> besides paying naked women to talk to them at a seedy club. Those who did not were at a special place in their lives. There is something about seeing a fat, balding man trying to “make it rain” in a strip club before sunset that made us all reevaluate this whole long-term single lifestyle.</p>

<div class="image floatright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="../files/bachelor_10.jpg" alt="bachelor_10.jpg"/>
<div class="caption">&nbsp;</div>
</div>


<p>But we had a good time all the same. Just as I was sitting down to enjoy a lap dance, my friend Will came up and told me we needed to leave immediately. He was nervous and said there was an emergency. Not wanting to leave just yet, I asked what the hurry was. He told me his dad had just died.</p>

<p>Seeing as his father has both MS and diabetes, I knew this was a legitimate possibility. Not wanting to leave, I briefly hesitated &#8211; his dad would still be dead in another 10 minutes, right? But I decided to get up, and we immediately left. As soon as we got outside, I found out that his dad was fine, but he just panicked because a stripper didn&#8217;t think he tipped enough and started yelling at him.</p>

<p>It was just as well &#8211; we needed to move on anyway. We met up with the rest of his friends and family at a bar near SMU. It reminded me why I love living in Austin: I apparently did not get the memo that the the bar was having a costume party. The theme this night was apparently a “frat party.” Most of the guys were wearing pink polo shirts, leather loafers with no socks, and I think I counted six different people wearing Titleist hats.</p>

<p>However, the first law of bars and parties is that where there are douchebags, hot women will follow. It’s a sad truth that was once again reaffirmed that night. It was just as good a place as any for several guys who were looking to prove they were single and still had game with the ladies.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t my best night with the women. I spent entirely too much time talking to one girl I later found out was still in high school. They really have some good fake IDs these days. As attractive as she was, talking to her made me feel like I was on <em>To Catch a Predator</em>, so I bolted and rejoined my friends. There wasn&#8217;t much else going on for me with the ladies that night.</p>

<p>But I had fun anyway, even if some of the girls were a little young. Now that I&#8217;m in my mid-20s, I have to accept the fact that if I am going to continue to hit on girls in their early 20s &#8211; and I will &#8211; they will be painfully unaware of most of my pop culture references. Like the time this night I purchased a song on the jukebox but wound up confusing the girl because she had never heard of Warren G. She had no idea what a Regulator was.</p>

<p>In the end, it was an enjoyable night of talking with old friends, reminiscing, and celebrating the fact that if I came to town again my friend would be able to go out drinking with me instead of going antiquing.</p>

<p>Will fared very well that night with the ladies. One young girl in particular, who was a friend of his sister, actually went home with him. It was a victory made all the more sweet due to the adversity he had to overcome. After breaking up with his fiance, he had to move back in with his parents. Any time you can get a girl to agree to go to your parents’ house to mess around, you know you threw down some serious game.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up with a horrific hangover made worse by the knowledge that I had to drive back to Austin to go to work. I contemplated lingering at my friend’s place until I felt better, but then his sister and mother got up and started cleaning the living room. His wheelchair-bound father woke up and received a visit from the nurse who helps care from him. The nurse helped Will’s father get out of bed and navigate his way to the kitchen for breakfast. Will’s sister then decided to let their large black lab and two pugs inside the house for the first time that day. It was a busy scene that a half-naked girl walked into as she got up to use the restroom. At least she already knew half the people there, so the introductions didn&#8217;t take so long.</p>

<p>As everyone was feeling sufficiently awkward, I decided to make my exit. </p>

<p>It was the perfect end to a celebration of the freedom of being single. After all, having spontaneous encounters with girls and obtaining funny stories about awkward situations is what being single is all about. Fortunately, I still have people to share it with me.</p>
