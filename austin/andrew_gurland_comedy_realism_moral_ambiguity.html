<p><em>Andrew Gurland blends comedy, realism, and moral ambiguity reminiscent of film noir to create films that are funny, memorable, uncomfortable, and surprising. For Gurland, his films aren&#8217;t a direct expression of how he views people and their actions, but are often a fantasy that allow him to vicariously explore what he doesn&#8217;t have the opportunity to do in reality, such as commit acts of revenge and hang around pretty girls. In this Q-and-A, Gurland reveals some of his influences, what he strives for in his films, and hints at what&#8217;s to come.</em></p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">That Other Paper</span> In <em>Fuck Gramaglia Up</em>, the character you portray says, &#8220;I enjoy the human experience and seeing how people react in certain situations.&#8221; How does this quote relate to your own motivations for making films?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Andrew Gurland</strong> Well, I mean most of the film, performance-wise, is all improvised, so it&#8217;s not like I spent a great deal of time on that line. Even though I usually work with a script, I like to keep it pretty loose.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What is your motivation for making films?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Well, it&#8217;s my job, firstly, and I guess I love the movies. I love all kinds of different movies, and I love being surprised. So, as a result, I&#8217;m always trying to surprise people.</p>



<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> So, what are some films that have surprised you?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I loved that scene in <em>Sarah Marshall</em> where he plays &#8220;Dracula&#8217;s Lament.&#8221; That blew my mind. That was just such a&#8211; Oh, man, that&#8217;s when it went from being a good movie to being a great movie, because you realized you were just getting all this insight into his darkness, but through a very funny moment, and it became so much realer.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Your films seem to provide an insight into how people act, and a lot of them, despite not being actual documentaries, are shot in the documentary style and seem to employ non-professional actors, which strengthens the perception that the characters in your films are real people, acting how real people act.</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Do you think that the way your characters act is an accurate representation of how real people act?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Oh, I couldn&#8217;t say that. I&#8217;m just trying to make people believe the moment; I&#8217;m not making any commentary on how people act.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> I noticed a parallel between your films and the way film noir seems to portray people, because both you and film noir, they seem to see people as paranoid, manipulative, motivated by personal gains or sex, and they seem to subscribe to a sort of morally ambiguous worldview. What do you think of film noir and this correlation?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Well, I will say that one of my great, if not my greatest influence in filmmaking, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Broomfield">Nick Broomfield</a>. I really love his movies. What blew my mind, when I saw the <em>Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer</em>, in the movie theater, was how he made himself as a documentarian film noir hero. Like, he was going to investigate this thing, and driving to this seedy place and meeting all these seedy people. And there was even a lot of comedy in it because he was playing it so dry, as though he were oblivious to everything. So, I never have thought about that comparison about myself before, but I was definitely conscious of it with what Nick Broomfield did. I thought, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s really interesting the way he&#8217;s doing that.&#8221; I was really studying documentary, and I think I was already making documentaries at that time, and also had a foot in the comedy world as well. I was doing some joke writing for Norm MacDonald on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, and I just saw that style that he was using in his movies, and then I went and subsequently rented some of his older movies. That was a great influence to me.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> How is it that you got involved with joke writing for <em>Saturday Night Live</em>?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I had a friend who was doing it, and I just got the fax number and was just faxing in jokes and that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What other television work have you done?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> After I had made a couple of movies and people starting come to me. So I did bunch of TV writing and directing. Some pilots for FX, Comedy Central, and a few other networks.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And how would you describe that experience?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I loved it. It turns over much quicker. You can get a TV show written and shot in a much shorter time. And I like working, and I&#8217;ve pretty much liked everything that I&#8217;ve done. I mean, one of the pilots that I worked on, I was assaulted by the star of the show with a piece of fruit, and that was very uncool.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Are you able to reveal&#8211;</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I can&#8217;t tell you who it is, but I&#8217;ll just say that he threw an apple at my testicles, and I didn&#8217;t care for it.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And what did you do to warrant that?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Well, what happened was I gave him a piece of direction that scared the horse, and the horse scared him. The crew laughed and he thought I was trying to make him look like a fool or something. It was like a horse in the ghetto type of thing, and I think just the horse really was agitating him.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And what was the horse doing in the ghetto?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> [laughs] Oh, he was&#8211; It was like a sketch about gas prices being so high that he had to get a horse in the ghetto. [laughs]</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> So, in general, what would you say is, if you&#8217;re able to remember, your first conscious memory of seeing or hearing things that made you laugh?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> You mean like as a baby?</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Well, not that early. Unless there was something very memorable.</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I mean, I would imagine it was, like with most little kids, things having to do with farting or shitting. I can&#8217;t remember one that&#8217;s specific, but I know I found those things hilarious when I was a kid. And, you know, I still do.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And was there a particular moment when you started to pay more attention to humor?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> It was the first thing I gravitated towards as something that I could see myself doing. I remember being a little kid and watching specials, like the ones Dean Martin would host. Martin or whoever hosted would bring out Don Rickles, Jonathan Winters, and people who, in a way, almost antagonized the audience, which was really appealing to me. That they could be both loved, but also confusing people and making them laugh all at the same time. Then I got really, really into Andy Kaufman. That was somebody who just really influenced me a great deal, because I wasn&#8217;t sure when he was kidding, and I love that feeling. So that&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;ve tried to chase. Where it looks like the characters or even the story, the filmmaker himself is oblivious to how funny what he&#8217;s doing is.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Some people, when they start seeing a lot of humor, they start to recreate it, like doing bits for their friends, is that something that you, yourself did?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Oh, for sure. I listened to comedy albums when I was a kid and watched all the comedy specials, and we repeated lines to each other, yeah. That was definitely something I did.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And, what were you like in school?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I was frequently truant. I would say that I was a class clown, but there were a lot of them. I wasn&#8217;t the class clown.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What are some of the things that you would do to get laughs from other people?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I would say sleazy things to girls, say obnoxious things to teachers &#8211; things like that. I was always trying to be funny for my parents, and my siblings and my friends. I would write funny speeches for my English class; or I would always figure out a way, if I had to do a book report, to do it in a funny voice.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Do you happen to remember any of the speeches that you gave?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I did something right after Reagan was shot by John Hinckley. I did it as John Hinckley, apologizing, but it was just a bunch of jokes about Jodie Foster. That&#8217;s about all I can remember, and I remember it was really on the border of bad taste, but was able to make the teacher laugh. So, I was always trying to walk that line.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And did your humor ever get you in trouble then?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> For sure. I remember one time the teacher got really mad over something really stupid. I think he asked me if he could be frank with me, and I said, &#8220;Okay, Frank.&#8221; and I remember that made him really mad.</p>

</div>


<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> I know that <em>Cheaters</em> was based on your own experiences with school, but I also read that <em>Mail Order Wife</em> was based on a real encounter that you had.</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> That was probably a joke. No, it&#8217;s not, I never had any real life. You know, sometimes I&#8217;ll say that my dad got a mail order bride or something, but sometimes you&#8217;re just doing an interview and act like a wise guy. There was nothing real about it.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> In <em>Cheaters</em>, <em>Mail Order Wife</em>, and many of your other films, revenge is a reoccurring theme.</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Yes. I love revenge, I really do. I find it very funny. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of things you can&#8217;t do in real life because you know they&#8217;re a waste of energy, so it&#8217;s fun to write about them. I do think that a lot of what I write about, or what I explore, is my fantasy life, so in real life, I don&#8217;t have the energy to get back at people, so I like to write about it. In real life, I&#8217;m just totally whipped by women so I like to explore misogynistic themes.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Other than <em>Cheaters</em>, how many of your films are based on actual experiences that you&#8217;ve had?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> they&#8217;re all inspired in some way. You could talk to me about any film, I could tell you where it comes from my real life. <em>Cheaters</em> is the only one that&#8217;s real literal. <em>Gramaglia</em> was very much inspired by real life because I made that right after I had won Sundance with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frat_House"><em>Frat House</em></a>, and all these actresses who were so sexy were hitting on me and I knew that I could do anything I wanted to them, but I couldn&#8217;t because I was already married. So, I was so angry with them, because why wouldn&#8217;t they fuck me before? They wouldn&#8217;t, but now they would because I won Sundance. So, I wanted to make a movie really exploring that hostility. So I got an actress naked and I asked her to do jumping jacks, because I was mad, so that was autobiographical. That whole story was made up so I could make a movie that ended with that scene.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And how about <em>Broken Condom</em>?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> <em>Broken Condom</em>, that&#8217;s really my wife, and she was nine months pregnant, and I was freaking out about having my first kid, so it was a great way to explore that tension in our relationship. And she really did start crying, because she was just so mad that I was putting her through that when she was nine months pregnant, so there was a lot&#8211; That was very real. Like, that moment where I tell her I&#8217;ll see her in court, and then I ask her if my suit is clean and she says, &#8220;You would know.&#8221; That&#8217;s really real. I don&#8217;t know if my suit is clean. [laughs]</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> How about <em>Black People Hate Me and My Glasses</em>?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I was Jew mugged a couple of times, which is when they mug you and break your glasses. </p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Were you used as bait to attract other&#8211;</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Yeah, that whole thing is true.</p>

</div>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Many of your films feature characters named Andrew Gurland who are also filmmakers. How do you compare to these fantasy counterparts?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I just have more self-awareness than the characters. I think it&#8217;s funny to be oblivious, but obviously I wouldn&#8217;t be able to write those scenes if I didn&#8217;t know that they were funny, if I didn&#8217;t know that the characters were acting ridiculous.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Other than get revenge, what are some other things that you would say you are able to do vicariously through your work?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Well, first of all, I love&#8211; The best part about making movies is I love to get to hang out with pretty girls. That part of it is amazing. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve shot something, so I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one where I can do that again.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And what is the next one that you&#8217;re working on?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> I am working on a teen sex comedy that takes place in Iraq. A lot of the soldiers that go over there are virgins. So, it&#8217;s kind of like a <em>Porky&#8217;s</em> meets <em>Platoon</em> kind of thing. I&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of soldiers and about what they did about having sex while they were over there.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And will this film be made for Adam McKay&#8217;s company?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Adam will be involved, yes.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And how is it that the two of you got in touch?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> Well, we knew each other vaguely at <em>SNL</em>. I was a really big fan of his writing, and then we bumped into each other again, and it turned out he was a fan of Frat House, so I pitched him this idea.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And when will filming begin on this?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">AG</strong> We are going to be going to Iraq this summer, shooting on location.</p>
