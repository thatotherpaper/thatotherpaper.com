<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Bob Saget</strong> Bradley Jackson? Bob Saget here.</p></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">That Other Paper</strong> Hey, Bob. How&#8217;s it going?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Good, man. How&#8217;re you doing?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Good, good. Just sitting by the phone. [<em>Sounding desperate</em>] Waiting for your call.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Sorry about that. I was just shooting <em>The Best Damn Sports Show [Period]</em>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> It&#8217;s no problem. I didn&#8217;t really have that much to do today anyways.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] Thanks.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> You directed one of my favorite comedies of all time, <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Dirty-Work-Norm-MacDonald/dp/0792842162/sr=8-1/qid=1171670713?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Dirty Work</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and a lot of people don&#8217;t really know you directed it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Well, they kinda do because people bring it to my shows and I sign it, and a lot of the press I&#8217;ve been doing for <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Penguins-Jackson-Alexander-Applegate-Voices/dp/B000JJSJD2/sr=1-1/qid=1171670785?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Farce of the Penguins</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> a lot of people go &#8220;Oh you directed Dirty Work, and that&#8217;s one of my favorite movies.&#8221; Which is like, <em>Thank goodness everyone grew up and figured it out.</em></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Exactly.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> I&#8217;m proud of it. We had an R-rated cut, but we had to cut out the dirty stuff.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> That&#8217;s a shame.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> I know. That&#8217;s what happens. It&#8217;s show business. People spend a lot of money on a movie and when it doesn&#8217;t perform, they get scared. It was a 12-million-dollar investment, which became a lot more with all the TV ads and stuff.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> I remember I saw it in theaters when I was 12, and it blew my mind.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] Those guys are hilarious. That was Norm [MacDonald] and Fred Wolfe and Frank Sebastiano that wrote it, and it was a very funny script.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> So what were your feelings like when it wasn&#8217;t that well-received when it came out?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Sad, you know. When you put your heart and soul into something and it doesn&#8217;t work out, it&#8217;s heartbreaking.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Another one of my favorite comedy moments from film history is from <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Half-Baked-Fully-Widescreen/dp/B0006HBZE2/sr=1-1/qid=1171670963?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Half Baked</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> when you had that great cameo. I&#8217;ve always wondered how that scene came about.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> It was in the script. The producer was a guy named Bob Simonds who I met because I was interested in directing <em>Half Baked</em>. (They gave it to Tamara Davis to direct &#8211; who is very god and did a great job on that movie.) And so when I was directing <em>Dirty Work</em> in Toronto they were filming <em>Half Baked</em> down the street. And I was friends with all those guys. I knew [Dave] Chappelle, Harland Williams, and Jim Bruer. We&#8217;re all in the trenches together. No matter how crispy-clean my TV image was, all the comedians knew. It&#8217;s like combat when you do stand-up. It&#8217;s kind of a hard-core thing to do. And that&#8217;s why I love it so much.</p>

<p>So they gave me the script and they said, &#8220;It&#8217;ll take two hours of your time.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s hilarious.&#8221; I knew it was funny the minute I read it, and it&#8217;s real dirty. For me it&#8217;s no big deal but for everyone else it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow. Opposite day. He was so clean on TV.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know why people think you are the person you are on TV. You know part of me was like that squeaky-clean guy because I was younger and I had young kids. Do I have a dirty house? No. Do I dustbust? Well, I have someone do that for me.</p>

<p>Anyways, it was kind of an opposite-day thing for me, and so many college kids and junior high kids like yourself saw it when you were young. And it&#8217;s so funny how one line can change things.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Well, it changed the world of comedy for me, at least.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> That&#8217;s funny. I&#8217;ll work for years on something and it won&#8217;t have the impact like something like <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Aristocrats-Penn-Jillette/dp/B000C3L2NE/sr=1-1/qid=1171671444?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Aristocrats</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which took me forty minutes.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Have you ever written a joke down and then crossed it out because it&#8217;s too vulgar?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> The ones that are too vulgar usually end up somehow seeing the light of day in my stand-up if vulgarity is the only issue. In <em>The Aristocrats</em>, the whole premise is [there are] some things people just don&#8217;t wanna hear. A lot of my audience is college kids because I&#8217;m more like them than people my own age. Sometimes the joke for me is that it&#8217;s so <em>wrong</em> &#8211; and that&#8217;s the joke. And it&#8217;s shock value, which (obviously) comedically doesn&#8217;t have the level of depth or value really as something that&#8217;s just incredibly clever or just really smart. I&#8217;ve got a couple that I&#8217;m real proud of, but then you look at Dave Chapelle and it&#8217;s all premise-related you know &#8211; it comes from a place where the subject matter is &#8220;ah HA!&#8221; It&#8217;s basically popular contemporary philosophy with a comedic bent. Sometimes there&#8217;s not even a joke.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> When did you first realize you were funny and what about that made you want to pursue stand-up and acting as a career?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> I never thought I&#8217;d pursue stand-up, and I never thought I&#8217;d pursue acting. I always thought I was gonna be a doctor because the doctor when I was young was a hero to me. When I was six he saved my dad. My dad had a heart attack and he saved him. I just lost my dad last week.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Wow. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Thank you. And it&#8217;s cool to be coming to town tomorrow because I&#8217;ve always wanted to do Austin. I did it years ago. There was some comedy club like twenty years ago, I can&#8217;t remember what it was. I walked around and went to the music clubs and went out of my mind. It&#8217;s real cathartic for me because my dad died last Tuesday, and we just finished the whole Jewish thing &#8211; the Shiva. And I&#8217;m doing the press for the <em>Penguin</em> movie. And I&#8217;m going there for one purpose. And it&#8217;s for me more than the audience. I know it&#8217;s a selfish thing, but I just get off on stand-up. I need it so bad. And my dad loved what I did.</p>

<p>To answer your question from a hundred minutes ago, I knew I was funny when I was real young because I would make the girls laugh. I was kind of a dog when I was six. I hadn&#8217;t hit puberty at all. I knew I had a penis, but I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I tried to make out and dry hump when I was six. [Comedy] gave me less fear as I got older. I never got much until I got older&#8230; [<em>Laughs</em>] That&#8217;s a nice thing for an interview.</p>

<p>I was like the class clown. I was either real popular, or I was more like Danny Tanner. So I was familiar [with] how to play that character. I would be this real sweet kid that would try to make the moms and aunts and neighbors happy, and then I would do things like start fires and like vandalize classrooms. But I was a good kid, so it was really weird. It was always this double-edged sword. I always had these odd demons.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Bob Saget, the pyromaniac. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> I one time lit a Band-Aid box on fire in my room with gasoline in it. And my mother walked by and I put it under the bed. I could have burned the house down, so I was a moron.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> I think we all were.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Yeah. And when I hit teen years, I moved from Virginia to California, so then I got all screwed up. Adolescence is hard no matter who you are. Unless you get facial hair when you&#8217;re eight.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> I still don&#8217;t have facial hair.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> That&#8217;s fine.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> If you had to pick one episode of <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Full-House-Complete-Sixth-Season/dp/B000LV6O12/sr=1-1/qid=1171671916?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Full House</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> to watch over and over again which one would you pick?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> I always say the last one.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Really.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> As a joke. There was one episode where I remember thinking, <em>That was kind of okay.</em> It was the fact that I was doing it. It was success. I remember having a girlfriend at the time who saw a t-shirt with my face on it and it said &#8220;No Nerds&#8221; and it crossed my face out like a no-smoking sign. I guess it was the beginning of being &#8220;iconified.&#8221; And to answer your question about <em>Full House</em> I would say the best <em>Full House</em> episode was when [Danny Tanner] was hooked on coffee. DJ was at her nightclub or working at some cafe, and I couldn&#8217;t stop drinking coffee. I was offering coffee from everyone and it was probably the most like me out of anything I ever did on the show. I put that on my reel. All three minutes of it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> And was Dave Coulier making Bullwinkle voices?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> He was doing it. And Dave is one of my best friends. I remember after my dad&#8217;s funeral me and Dave and John Stamos were back at my house. And Dave and John and I were standing around acting like idiots just talking filthy. That&#8217;s what we did you know. We just acted like fools.</p>

<p class="i last">Doopity bow bow wow!</p>
</div>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> That&#8217;s awesome.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Can you hold on just one second? I&#8217;m going to tell someone something real quick. [<em>Bob gives his driver directions</em>]</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> A lot of aspiring stand-up comedians read <em>That Other Paper</em>. What advice would you give these people who&#8211;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> Hold on one second. [<em>To the driver</em>] Here&#8217;s one right here. I&#8217;ll just hop out. [<em>To Bradley</em>] Sorry I&#8217;m&#8211; I&#8217;m actually running to an ATM. So the advice is: Always keep money on you. And never get caught with crap in your pants. Y&#8217;know? If anything happens to you and you&#8217;re killed&#8211; [<em>Laughs</em>] Sorry. You can say Bob Saget goes to an ATM during the interview. So unattractive. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> That&#8217;ll be a footnote.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> The main thing is to follow your own voice. As soon as you can, find out who you are. I&#8217;ll hear someone do a bit, and I&#8217;ll go, &#8220;Oh, my God. That&#8217;s the most derivative thing I&#8217;ve ever heard.&#8221; The key is to really, really try &#8211; no matter how much you love another comedian &#8211; not to be like them. And not just material. I&#8217;ll watch some of the new guys and think, <em>My God. They move like Dane Cook. How much are they watching Dane Cook?</em> Try to find your own voice.</p>

<p>Rodney Dangerfield, who was a friend of mine, gave me the best advice. He said, &#8220;Just go like a tank. Straight ahead, like a tank, with blinders on.&#8221; Because everyone tries to stop you.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> One last question. If you had thirty seconds to tell one last joke before you died, what would you tell?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">BS</strong> There&#8217;s a guy out in the woods hunting, and he&#8217;s about to shoot at a bear. The bear charges him, throws him to the ground, rips off the clothes and rapes him. The guy goes to the hospital, and about a month later he goes back to the same part of the woods. The same bear comes up, grabs him, throws him to the ground, rips off his clothes, rapes him, and leaves him for dead. So he goes to the hospital, and about a month later the guy goes back to the same spot in the woods, and the bear runs over to rape him. But just as he&#8217;s about to knock him down, he just taps the hunter on the shoulder and goes, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t come here just to hunt, did you?&#8221;</p>
