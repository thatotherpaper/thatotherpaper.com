Here, Showalter discusses <span class="noem">The Michael Showalter Showalter</span> and the state of comedy today.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">That Other Paper</strong> What inspired you to enter the arena of stand-up, and when did you get involved?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Michael Showalter</strong> I started doing little bits at clubs in New York a long time ago, but it was never really serious. It was more like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do the entire <em>NY Times</em> Sunday crossword puzzle in one minute&#8221; and then I&#8217;d struggle to answer one clue in the time. Then, after <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Stella-Season-One-John-Hamburg/dp/B000FZETJS?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1173887778&sr=1-1&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Stella</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> was over and <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Baxter-Elizabeth-Banks-II/dp/B000BMY2K6?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1173887637&sr=8-1&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Baxter</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> had come and gone, I really wanted to take a break from production. I started doing stand-up, and it was fun. I liked the immediacy of it. Eugene Mirman, Leo Allen, and I went out on the road in May for two weeks. I realized that I had about an hour of material and I&#8217;ve been working pretty hard at it all year. My stand-up is still pretty alternative. I do lots of visual, PowerPoint-type stuff and use music. It works better in a music club than at a traditional comedy club.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Are alienation and outsiderdom essential components of being funny?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> I&#8217;m not sure. I definitely feel a lot of alienation and outsiderdom personally. I can&#8217;t say if there&#8217;s any direction relationship there. I do think that it might give you a different perspective on things if you&#8217;re always on the outside looking in.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Do bad comedians know they&#8217;re bad?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> No, of course not. Good comedians know when they&#8217;re bad. Bad comedians never know.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> In your opinion, what are some indications of good and bad comedy?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> The best comedy is comedy that you have to go to and figure out. Ricky Gervais or Stephen Colbert &#8211; you need to get on their page. When something is trying to give you what they <em>think</em> you will find funny, it leaves me cold. Is it called &#8220;pandering&#8221;?</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What do you think of the state of comedy today?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> I think it&#8217;s good. I like the direction it&#8217;s moving in. It seems like there&#8217;s more outlets for people whose sensibilities are left of center.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> How was your Aspen Comedy Festival experience?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> Fun. The altitude kind of got to me. I was huffing oxygen out of tanks the whole time. I found myself holding the air in my lungs like it was pot (just out of habit), and then exhaling, being like, &#8220;Wow, man &#8211; that was really good air.&#8221;</p>


<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> How did <em>The Michael Showalter Showalter</em> come to be?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> <a href="http://collegehumor.com/" rel="nofollow">CollegeHumor.com</a> asked me if I&#8217;d do some shorts for them. I wanted to think of something that would really easy to shoot. I&#8217;ve always liked the <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Larry-Sanders-Show-Entire-Season/dp/0767847563?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1173888573&sr=1-2&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Larry Sanders</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> format &#8211; the behind-the-scenes feel. I think that human foible is the funniest thing. My character on the show is broke and desperate to get ahead in the business. He&#8217;s interviewing all these cool comedians and then hitting them up for money when the cameras are off. I interviewed David Cross for an upcoming episode &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to get him to read a script I wrote, and he won&#8217;t read it even though I tell him that I wrote the part with him in mind. I like the idea of the pathetic hero.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> How much of the show is scripted and how much is improvised?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> It&#8217;s all improvised but I know what I&#8217;m going for, which is to say I told <a href="zach_galifianakis_bible_full_of_typos.html">Zach Galifianakis</a> and Michael Ian Black that when the cameras were off I&#8217;d be asking them if I could borrow money. The rest is improv.</p>

</div>


<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> The feel of the show is reminiscent of <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Actors-Studio-Streisand-Eastwood/dp/B000H6SY1Y?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1173888683&sr=1-2&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Inside the Actors Studio</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> or <em>Charlie Rose</em>. What do you think of those two shows?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> I think that <em>Actors Studio</em> is utterly absurd. Deep insights from Drew Barrymore on the art of acting &#8211; it&#8217;s totally lost the thread. Charlie Rose is a fantastic show. The interviews are intimate and comprehensive. In no uncertain terms I&#8217;m copying Charlie Rose. I only wish I was as smart as he is. My host is relatively incapable of conducting a good interview. I ask stupid questions like, &#8220;How do you think of an idea?&#8221; Maybe I&#8217;ll get better though.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> With two professors as parents, was television something that was frowned upon in the Showalter household?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> Not at all. My parents are very culturally aware. I watched every episode of every sitcom that came out pre-1988.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What are your earliest memories of comedy, of seeing or hearing things that made you laugh?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/National-Lampoons-Animal-Widescreen-Probation/dp/B0000A02TZ?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1173888844&sr=1-1&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Animal House</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> changed my life. Early Benny Hill. I loved Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Michael Keaton, Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Woody Allen, Monty Python, Chevy Chase, <em>Cheers</em>, <em>Three&#8217;s Company</em>. </p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Are you able to pinpoint the first time that you were consciously aware that you were able to make people laugh?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> That&#8217;s an excellent question. I always felt that I was funny but that no one really knew it. When I was in middle school they had &#8220;Funniest&#8221; and &#8220;Class Clown&#8221; [awards]. I remember I counted the votes &#8211; I don&#8217;t think that I got a single vote. I don&#8217;t walk around thinking I&#8217;m funny. I&#8217;m totally at loss when people say, &#8220;You&#8217;re a comedian? Make me laugh.&#8221; When people ask me what I do and I say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a comedian,&#8221; they are surprised because I don&#8217;t really seem funny in real life. I&#8217;m sort of dour. That&#8217;s common among comics I think. It&#8217;s like that line in <a class="i" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http://www.amazon.com/Crimes-Misdemeanors-Caroline-Aaron/dp/B00005AUJK?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1173888913&sr=1-1&tag=thaothpap-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thaothpap-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> when Alan Alda says, &#8220;Comedy is serious.&#8221;</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What were you like in school?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> Relatively normal. I was kind of self-conscious. Wanted to be popular. A virgin until college. I was arty but not very focused. I got pretty bad grades.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> How&#8217;d you get your laughs as a kid?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> I was always good at ragging on people. I have a rapier-like wit.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Is school something that you enjoyed?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> Not particularly. I liked college. I went to Brown and did lots of theater and improv. I was never a great student. Mostly just kind of lazy. I liked doing what I liked doing. I enjoyed certain classes and certain professors a lot. I took a film class at NYU my freshman year before I transferred to Brown and it really opened my eyes to a lot of things. It was mostly a genre class. I love film genres: Westerns, film noirs, that stuff. I liked deconstructing genres and watching movies from that perspective. It really influenced a lot of stuff I&#8217;ve done since. Most of the major projects I&#8217;ve done are genre deconstruction: <em>Stella</em>, <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em>, and <em>The Baxter</em>.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What are some other projects that you&#8217;re currently involved in or contemplating?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> Michael Ian Black and I are co-creating a new show for Comedy Central called <em>Michael Ian Black Doesn&#8217;t Understand</em>. I&#8217;m making a comedy record this summer. Going back out on tour. I&#8217;d like to write another movie soon. I have an idea but I&#8217;m avoiding writing it because I know that I&#8217;ll get consumed by it once I start.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What do you like to do after a performance?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MS</strong> Smoke a cigarette.</p>
