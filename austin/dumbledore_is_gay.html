<p><span class="red">WARNING:</span> This Perspective contains <em>Harry Potter</em> spoilers.</p>

<p>I have always been a Harry Potter purist, the kind of fan who gets a high that lasts for days when any tidbit of information comes out about the books, the kind of fan who wants J.K. Rowling for the Nobel Prize in Literature and statues of her in every city. And when a new book comes out, I’m damn near impossible to calm down, calling every fan I know to talk about it until our jaws fall off. So last week was heaven for me with J.K. Rowling’s announcement about the religious allegory in the books and the more controversial announcement that Albus Dumbledore, benevolent puppet master of wizardly ways, was gay.</p>

<p>
I, of course, was ecstatic at the news. It explained so much about the narrative &#8211; why Dumbledore never got married and why he was so obsessed with Grindelwald. </p>

<p>
And the fact that the news came on the heels of her announcement that Harry Potter is a Christian allegory (which everyone suspected already and the announcement only confirmed) could only mean one thing &#8211; she was trying to connect the two and show her religious readers that being gay doesn’t preclude you from morality or spirituality.</p>

<p>
That’s what it looks like to a fan like me who has spent a great portion of her life reading and analyzing the books.  To many others, however, it looks a lot different.  It looks like a huge publicity stunt.  When my friend Claire first expressed this opinion to me, my initial thought was, &#8220;Not possible!  The woman has more money than God and readers who would shave her back if given the chance.  She does not need the publicity.&#8221;  But after listening to what Claire had to say, I realized that publicity had to be a part of it.  And that realization was a kick in the face.</p>

<p>
Claire is somewhat more savvy than me and isn’t a huge fan of the books. &#8220;It seems really random,&#8221; she told me, &#8220;and most writers say things like that to get people talking again, especially when they’ve got another book on the way like she does.&#8221; And the announcement seemed a little late for it to be merely adding to the tale. Why wouldn’t Rowling have said Dumbledore was gay sooner after the final book came out? By waiting so long to release this information, she was trying to get conservative parents to buy books that amount to homosexual propaganda for their children.  Claire told me that a gay friend of hers feels betrayed and used, like Rowling is using the hot-button issue of homosexuality for her own gain.</p>

<p>
Entertaining the idea that Rowling’s intentions weren’t entirely pure upset me.  It shattered my naive perception of the books as a labor of love that just happened to make a lot of money because it really was that amazing. Then I calmed down a bit and realized that the marketing was likely only one aspect of it, not the whole story. </p>

<p>
Claire was one hundred percent right about something: Rowling knows how to market herself. For example, the first three books in the series were all released within a year of each other in order to build interest. Often, people will read the first book in a series and look forward to the second book for a while, but if the second book takes too long to come out, they’ll lose interest. This was a real danger for Rowling since her story is a seven-book plot arc instead of seven one-plot-arc books. The story doesn’t really get going until book three, so she had to figure out a way to get people to read them all at once. Hence the close release dates &#8211; a smart move that no one had made before. Also, anyone who watches the news at all knows that her unpublished books have more security on them than the president, which, of course, creates fervor bordering on madness in her fans.  She has always been very careful about what she revealed and when. Before the publication of Half-Blood Prince, for example, she told us that there was a new character who &#8220;looked rather like an old lion.&#8221; Just that little description opened up the board again for speculation and reignited excitement. Pure marketing genius.
So why it didn’t occur to me that this was part of the same machine I don’t understand. But, even given this, I still believe that there is more to it than just publicity.</p>

<p>
I think Rowling waited three months to make sure everyone had a chance to finish the book. Lots of fans are adults who lead very busy lives and it might have taken them that long to finish. And I think she didn’t include that piece of information in the books for a couple of reasons: One, it didn’t have a place in them. The books have a very heavy subtext of tolerance, but it’s just that: a sub-text. Being overt about it would be out of place. For instance, she addresses racism with the house-elves and sexism with Hermione, but never directly. Also, I think she wanted to fully illustrate the character and make us fall in love with him before telling the world he is gay. The man is quirky, respected, powerful. He likes Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, candy-related passwords, socks, and saving the wizarding world. He is one of the most influential people in wizarding society, someone that everyone looks up to as an authoritative figure yet, at the same time, their friend. Not to mention that he is one of the most fascinating characters from a literary standpoint that I’ve ever encountered.</p>

<p>
Yes, Rowling obviously wanted to show the world a positive portrait of a homosexual because, frankly, there aren’t a whole lot of those. That’s a nicer way of looking at what Claire said about foisting homosexual propaganda on people. Rowling was obviously unwilling to risk alienating readers so she waited until everyone had finished the books before telling everyone their favorite character was gay.</p>

<p>
She planned it perfectly.  She knew that waiting until everyone had read the books and she’d been out of the news for a while would create the exact media blitz that she wanted to get her message about gay tolerance heard.  Some see this as a misstep; I see it as another immaculately executed move.</p>

<p>But most of all, the information really does add to the story.  It adds further depth to an adored character and answers some questions about Dumbledore’s past.  If Dumbledore had married, he would never have been able to manipulate people and events to lead to Voldemort’s downfall.  It also explains why he, and only he, could take down Grindelwald, who almost matched Voldemort in evilness: He knew Grindelwald in the intensely personal way that only someone who loves you can know you.  </p>

<p>
As a former English major, I operate from the standpoint that everything in a story happens for a reason.  All literature has a message &#8211; that’s the definition of it. A large part of the message of Harry Potter is tolerance, and Dumbledore’s homosexuality adds to that. People are shocked to see Rowling come out with such a strong message since they’re used to thinking about Harry Potter as light children’s reading. Maybe this will make them reconsider the books as something to be studied and understood as well as enjoyed.</p>

<p>
But, of course, books, like everything else, are business, and along with that go marketing and publicity. This is what I’ve come to realize. And I can let this realization affect me in one of two ways: I can be sad and depressed about it, or I can marvel at how masterfully she manipulated us all.  I choose to admire her.  She’s just like Dumbledore, releasing choice pieces of information at certain points to get a desired result.  As heartbreaking as it is, I am glad to be rid of my rose-colored glasses. I’ve begun to accept that just because something is business doesn’t mean I can’t love it, a lesson that will affect how I view the world for the rest of my life. </p>

<p>This piece of news didn’t just change how I thought about the narrative, it changed how I think about myself. And that is what true literature does.  </p>

<p>Bravo, Jo.</p>
