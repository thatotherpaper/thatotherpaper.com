<p class="em">Singer/songwriter Joshua Radin&#8217;s music has been praised by <span class="noem">Rolling Stone</span> and <span class="noem">Entertainment Weekly</span>, has appeared in hit shows like <span class="noem">Scrubs</span> and <span class="noem">Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</span>, and has been featured in the Zach Braff film <span class="noem">The Last Kiss</span>. He&#8217;s been on tour this past year in support of his debut album, <span class="noem">We Were Here</span>. He recently played at the Parish in Austin along with supporting act Schuyler Fisk. Here, <span class="noem">That Other Paper</span> contributor Bradley Jackson chats with Josh about screenwriting, Clear Channel, and why he finds Zach Braff attractive.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">That Other Paper</strong> What kind of songs and artists did you listen to while you were growing up?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Joshua Radin</strong> Well, I have really eclectic music tastes. So many different artists. I love jazz, but in terms of influences of mine, I&#8217;d have to say the greats.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> The classics?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Yeah. The classics like Cat Stevens and James Taylor. Guys that for the rest of your life you can put on and just love. Kind of like non-trendy stuff. Not to say that&#8217;s bad because I&#8217;m a child of the &rsquo;80s. You know, there&#8217;s a certain thing I love about doing &rsquo;80s covers and taking them and making them more acoustically driven, more singer/songwriter-y.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Have you ever thought of doing a really hardcore &rsquo;80s cover on acoustic?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Like Quiet Riot.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Maybe even a little Winger. &#8220;She&#8217;s Only 17.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> [<em>laughs</em>] I have, but I see artists do that kind of stuff all the time, and I have a problem with it because it becomes a little jokey. If I were to do a Winger cover or Bon Jovi&#8230; You know, if I were to do a Motorhead cover, it&#8217;d be like, okay, the joke&#8217;s gotten old, and now we&#8217;re just listening to a guy with an acoustic guitar sing Winger. It&#8217;s become a little open mic-ish. Some artists do like to do some jokey stuff in their set and it works great, but for me it&#8217;s more of a serious thing. It tends to not work as well with me, but I have thought about it, believe me.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> You haven&#8217;t always wanted to be a musician. You were originally a screenwriter, right?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I was a screenwriter. I mean, I still am. I actually grew up as a painter. I&#8217;d been taking art lessons since I was a little kid and I studied fine art, painting and drawing at Northwestern, and then I taught art to inner city kids in Chicago after school. I worked at a gallery in Chicago and thought that was what I was gonna do. About three or four years after school, I finally had the realization that the only way to do art and pay the rent is to have a trust fund. But you know I love art; I&#8217;ll probably go back to teaching art to kids at some point in my life. I love it. Especially to inner city kids because they really appreciate it. But for some reason, I just was like, you know what, I wanna try something new. And I&#8217;d always loved film. When I was in South Africa, I taught a film class on American cinema. I&#8217;d viewed film as a hobby my whole life. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never taken a class on this, I&#8217;ve never written a screenplay or even read a screenplay, but I&#8217;m just gonna give it a shot.&#8221;</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> How&#8217;d you do?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I sold two, but neither ended up getting made. It was just a lot of red tape and getting people attached and companies optioning your script for a year and then another year, and you&#8217;d keep getting paid and it would be enough to barely get by. And until you get a movie made, you have no power in the business and it&#8217;s impossible to attach actors, directors and producers. And I was writing scripts that had $15 to $20 million budgets, which is not necessarily the best way to go about it. I was about to turn thirty and I&#8217;d been playing guitar as a hobby for about two years in my living room. My girlfriend at the time, who was the only one who knew I could sing or play, was like, &#8220;You should go down to the open mic in the West Village and play a couple of songs.&#8221; So I did. I wanted to write an original, which was my song &#8220;Winter.&#8221; I played the song for my friend Zach Braff and he was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re even a musician. You should write a song for my movie <em>Garden State</em>.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I mean, this song kinda just came out. I was really intimidated and I didn&#8217;t have any money to record and I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. I was in the film world and the art world. I didn&#8217;t want him to do me any favors, and he was going after big acts like Coldplay. It ended up being kind of a big mistake on my part. I mean, I had no idea the film would even sell at Sundance.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Let alone be the soundtrack for people&#8217;s lives.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Totally. So when <em>The Last Kiss</em> came about, he was like, &#8220;You ready to write a couple songs for this?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Uhhh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Well, I&#8217;m glad you learned your lesson.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I kind of went about it in a backwards way. I was moving out to LA and playing at the Hotel Café and there were music supervisors there all the time looking for new musicians. And the music supervisor for <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em> came in and put two of my songs on the show. And, like, almost every TV show out there has used a song off this record. So I guess I&#8217;ve just been super lucky to find a career later in life.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> So your music&#8217;s been on <em>Scrubs</em> and <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em>, but I&#8217;ve never heard your songs on mainstream radio.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Let&#8217;s hope not. [<em>laughs</em>]</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> And it seems like you don&#8217;t even need to have a song on the radio to be successful anymore.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Well, that&#8217;s partially true. It depends on what you want out of your career. Do you want to just get by and pay your bills by playing music (which I think basically means you&#8217;re a success)? I mean, there&#8217;s plenty of other ways. There&#8217;s the Internet, there&#8217;s MySpace, there&#8217;s touring, licensing for TV and film, advertisements &#8211; you can definitely make a decent living. But there&#8217;s no way you can break a million records without radio exposure. And my music is really mellow, and you&#8217;re not gonna hear mellow on the radio unless it&#8217;s by Norah Jones. And Norah had to sell 250,000 records to get played on the radio. I never hear Regina Spektor on the radio. I never hear Imogen Heap on the radio. You look at what&#8217;s on mainstream, top-40 radio and it&#8217;s nothing you really want to listen to.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> You&#8217;ve kind of got a really unique voice in that it&#8217;s very quiet.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I&#8217;m a really mellow guy. When I get angry, it&#8217;s more depression than anger. I don&#8217;t really have rage in me; it&#8217;s more just sadness.</p>

</div>


<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> How long does it usually take to write a song?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I usually take a lot of time, but sometimes a song comes out in like fifteen minutes. Sometimes they take weeks.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> You&#8217;re kind of in a fraternity of musicians at the Hotel Café with Alexi Murdoch, Joe Purdy, and Carey Brothers. Does playing with those guys so much help you with writing and performing, or does it ever intimidate you?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I remember reading something in [Bob] Dylan&#8217;s <em>Chronicles</em> book: When Dylan started playing in the West Village, his idol at the time, Dave Von Romph, said to him, &#8220;No envy, no fear.&#8221; So I&#8217;ve kind of made that my mantra &#8211; if I have a mantra. I like to pull from all the other guys around me. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense to be envious. Especially if it&#8217;s good. It just means better music is getting out into the world and we&#8217;re trying to change it from the Clear Channel top-40 bullshit.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What are some of your current favorite artists around?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Brett Dennen, Ben Harper, Damien Rice, Ray LaMontagne.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> So once this tour&#8217;s over, what&#8217;s next for you?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I have three more dates on this tour and we finish up in LA. Then I&#8217;ll be writing the next record, which I have about half done. And then I&#8217;ll probably be going back into the studio for the next record.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> So when are you going to have that done?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I hope to have it done by August and then I guess it&#8217;s up to the label to when they release it.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What&#8217;s it gonna sound like?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I guess it&#8217;ll sound half like <em>We Were Here</em> and half&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna mix it up a little bit. A little more upbeat songs.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> We gonna hear any drum solos?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> No drum solos for this one. It&#8217;s a little happier though. Because I&#8217;m not really depressed anymore.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> That&#8217;s always good.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> I&#8217;d like to do something now called &#8220;No Explanation Necessary&#8221;: I&#8217;ll ask you five questions, and you answer <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em> without explaining yourself.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Okay.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Have you ever been heckled on stage?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> No.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Have you ever punched someone in the face?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> No.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Do you understand why women find Zach Braff attractive?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> [<em>laughs</em>] Yes.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Okay. I wish I could ask you to explain that but&#8230;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Well, he&#8217;s my best friend.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Fair enough. Do you like girls who smoke?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> I can&#8217;t really answer that. I guess I&#8217;m indifferent.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> If you were a renegade police officer who regularly brought down drug lords and mafia kingpins, would you grow a moustache?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> Yes. Has anyone ever answered no to that question?</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> That&#8217;s actually the first time I&#8217;ve asked that question in an interview. I like to mix it up sometimes.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> [<em>laughs</em>] I saw a great band name yesterday called the Junior High Moustache.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> [<em>laughs</em>] That&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">JR</strong> An awesome band name, right? I know. I&#8217;m gonna make that my backup band&#8217;s name. It&#8217;s gonna be Joshua Radin and the Junior High Moustaches.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> I would go see that double booking. Sounds like a jazz trio.</p>
