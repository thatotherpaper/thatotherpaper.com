<p class="em">Mike O&#8217;Connell sees a certain seriousness pervading the world. The sort of thing that might put a damper on your day or ruin your weekend. His advice: Laugh at it. Laughing and getting others to laugh has helped Mike O&#8217;Connell tremendously, whether it be making a joke when he didn&#8217;t know the answer in class or coming to terms with his own mortality.</p>

<p class="em">Mike&#8217;s made a lot of people laugh, which has earned him the title of <span class="noem">Rolling Stone</span>&#8217;s Hot Comic of 2005, a spot as one of <span class="noem">Variety</span>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960239.html?categoryid=2453&cs=1">Ten Comics to Watch</a> in 2007, made his video <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/9aa9642448"><span class="noem">What&#8217;s It Gonna Be</span></a> one of the most watched on <span class="noem">Funnyordie.com</span>, and earned him a production deal with MTV Studios.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">That Other Paper</span> What is your earliest memory of seeing or hearing things that make you laugh?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Mike O&#8217;Connell</strong> My grandfather was a really big humor inspiration. When I was little he was just a silly, silly man. He kind of didn&#8217;t live in the adult world. He was always making me feel that it was okay to be funny; that being funny was a beautiful part of life.</p>



<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What do you mean by &#8220;okay to be funny&#8221;?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I would say that there&#8217;s a certain kind of seriousness that pervades the world. I&#8217;ve always just enjoyed people that live with a sense of humor. I know a lot of people kind of don&#8217;t and take a lot of things pretty seriously. That way of seeing the world is slightly superior. [laughs]</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What makes it superior?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I think it&#8217;s better to go through the world lightly, with the attitude that it can all be laughed at.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Was your grandfather the primary influence on your comedic sensibility at a young age?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> He kind of had a corny sense of humor. He allowed me to see the world in a silly way. Later on my parents took me to Second City &#8211; I grew up in Chicago &#8211; so I was going there for a long time, and that was a big part of my world.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Seeing Second City at a young age, were you able to see some performers who were big stars?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I saw Chris Farley, Bob Odenkirk, Steve Carell. Those guys are obviously amazingly talented, but to see them live, from five feet away, is very inspiring.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Did your parents actively bring comedy into the house?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> There were a lot of Woody Allen books around. That was a big early inspiration. All of Woody&#8217;s writings I read very, very voraciously. They always had a good sense of humor. We all love laughing, the O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What were you like in school?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I was shy for a very long time. I never did very well in school; I was kind of a mediocre to bad student. I finally realized that having a creative mind is not in your best interest at a young age because if you&#8217;re not good at math and you&#8217;re not good at science then that looks very bad. You&#8217;re more expected to figure out what you&#8217;re good at when you&#8217;re older.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> You were shy in school, but what were you like amongst your friends?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I&#8217;ve always had a lot of energy, so I&#8217;ve always enjoyed being energetic and crazed. I was not the clown but the spaz, a little bit.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> At what age did people start noticing your comedic abilities?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I starting running for president in 8th grade, and I would write ridiculous songs to try to win the student council presidency. It worked. People starting saying, &#8220;You have the ability or the nerve to do this stupid bullshit in front of people.&#8221; I guess that&#8217;s one of the things that not everybody can do: embarrass themselves publicly.  </p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Since you were shy before then, when was it that got you to came out of your shell?</strong></p>

</div>


<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Around that time, 13, I realized that it&#8217;s a big benefit to be able to make people laugh. It can kind of change a situation, y&#8217;know? You can kind of disarm people. Also, once you see people laughing, it&#8217;s kind of hard to turn back. To see someone laugh really hard at what you&#8217;re doing is an addictive, beautiful thing.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Was there a particular situation that made you realize this usefulness of humor?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> In school, when you don&#8217;t know something, you can make a joke. That at least throws people off. [laughs] That happened quite often; not reading something and then trying to bullshit my way through it. You make the kids laugh. You get a reward &#8211; you still get a B. With older people, if you can make the dean laugh, that&#8217;s pretty good. It changes the relationship.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Do you think that by being funny you may be counteracting a sense of 
inadequacy caused by a defect of self or circumstance, i.e. poverty or 
social ineptitude? It&#8217;s kind of a tool to make things easier to go through. Did you fine this to be your own experience?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> It is a response to the way the world is. It can be very difficult. It can be very surreal in its punishment. It&#8217;s not about how I was neglected when I was little. I also like the creative aspect. It&#8217;s nice to create things.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What did you mean when you mentioned the punishments of the world?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I think when everybody goes through the world, there are experiences that are strange and private and just go on in your head. Everybody thinks about the point of everything. It&#8217;s a really funny thing that we all have in common. We all go through the same thing: You have a life and you try to figure out what it&#8217;s all about.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What&#8217;d you think of all the philosophy in Woody Allen&#8217;s writing?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Woody Allen talks about philosophical issues in a really funny way. It&#8217;s always blown my mind. I think that you can use comedy to address whatever you want. I find philosophy to be very funny. Thousands and thousands of years of philosophers have come up short. It&#8217;s ripe for parody. Plus, we can all do what they do, which is think about what life is about.</p>

</div>


<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Did you participate in any clubs when you were in school?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> No, I was just doing theater stuff and playing football. Other than that, I was just sort of smoking cigarettes. [laughs] I also did do these ice shows for a couple of years, back in the day. Which was pretty awesome. It was pretty manly.
 
<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> You did what?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Ice shows. Skate dancing. Dancing on ice. I was 10 at the time. We did a <em>Rocky</em>-based piece. I had a big solo where I went into the middle and lifted a big weight. It really just changed my life. [laughs] If there were a tape of that I would just fall over.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Was this like figure skating?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Kind of. They would try to make it as manly as possible. Unless we were wearing spangled outfits, which we actually did once.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> So they would pick different movies and make that the theme?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> <em>Rocky</em> was just the one, I think. The other ones were generally a little more flamboyant in the outfit area.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> How long did you do this?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I did that for about two years. I was playing hockey, and my dad was pleased by that, but my mom was like, &#8220;They should do an ice show, too!&#8221; [laughs] Which is very logical.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> And how did everyone react to these performances?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I don&#8217;t remember much. It was like going to a Spring Sing, where everybody&#8217;s required to go and be really happy about it, even thought it&#8217;s just a bunch of kids who can&#8217;t skate lifting fake weights and wearing sweatsuits stuffed with newspaper to look like they&#8217;re bulked up.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What music were you doing this to?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> (sings) &#8220;Gettin&#8217; strong now&#8230;.&#8221; [laughs]. That one &#8211; the theme. Man, you feel like a champion when that song plays and you&#8217;re little, and the lights are on you.</p>


<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> How did you feel about school then?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I loved English and reading, all that stuff. It&#8217;s great for so many reasons and terrible for so many reasons. If you have a talent for something that doesn&#8217;t fit in with schooling, I think you might feel small for those years. Especially if you don&#8217;t have a very practical talent.</p>


<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> How did you display your eccentric behaviors?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I had a lot of leisure suits. My grandfather had these old velour pajamas. I would wear those to school. My parents just hated it. One time my father was scolding me for grades &#8211; he&#8217;ll hate that I said this &#8211; he&#8217;s goes, &#8220;Y&#8217;know why you get C&#8217;s? Because you dress like an idiot. That effects what people think of you, ya know that?&#8221; [laughs] &#8220;Yeah, that seems to be the case, but I got these clothes, so what am I supposed to do?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What other eccentric sort of behaviors did you exhibit?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I was a very excited young man. [laughs] I would take off my clothes at parties. That kinda guy.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> You keep referring to yourself as &#8220;that guy.&#8221; Do you think that some sort of outsiderdom, alienation, or isolation play a role in &#8211; not just your own development as a comedian &#8211; but the development of comedians in general?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Standup, especially. If you go deep, it is a kind of solitary endeavor. Even though the audience, of course, is so necessary. But all the work you do is in your head, so I think that if you&#8217;re doing it right, it is private. I remember somebody once said, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just overthinking everything.&#8221; Yeah, I guess that is sorta true. [laughs] If you over think, you think about some of the darker stuff.</p>


<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What is your view on death?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Before you die, it&#8217;s very important to have as much joy as you can, and not be afraid to do that.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Death can strike at any moment, so do you think we should always try to be joyful?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s probably a pretty good way to live.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> If your death was imminent, what would you do?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I would probably try to write as many songs as I could. Try and be as creative as I can. I don&#8217;t think I would go to Egypt or something. I would just try and concentrate on what I have to offer to the world.</p>


<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What is it that you did after graduating from high school?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I went to Loyola of New Orleans. That was a good time. In my hometown it felt like the &rsquo;50s, almost. Safe, suburban. Then I went down to New Orleans and it was a very, very different world. That was a big eye-opener.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What were some things that were different for you?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> Well, freedom. Not like I was chained in the basement. I did live in the basement, but I was not chained there. Just the freedom to do whatever you want. The drinking age was 18. I got drunk and crazy. Culturally, it was amazing. The music and the people. The people of New Orleans are the asset of the city. I was just there a couple weeks ago, and everybody is like your neighbor. It&#8217;s something I miss.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What came first for you, improv or standup comedy?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I was doing plays at Loyola. Somebody in the play asked me to come do this improv group. I did that, and that&#8217;s where I met Dr. Ken. The head of the group was having a standup competition, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I put you in the competition. Write some jokes.&#8221; I did it, and I got to the finals with my first performance. I thought I was gonna win it, and, of course, I totally didn&#8217;t. It was pretty, pretty funny. It was a great night because I realized I could do it. The woman in front of me was about 15 years older, and she went up with a belt full of dildos. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Look at this one!&#8221; and that was her act. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Man, I&#8217;m gonna look like a pro!&#8221; [laughs]</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> After that, did you start doing open mics in the area?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I did open mics every once in a while. I continued to do the improv group and plays, things like that.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> How long were you in New Orleans?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I was there for four years. At my last improv show, Ken was there, and somebody got mugged in front of the place, and the bartender shot a shotgun, sending everybody scattering. I thought, &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s time to leave.&#8221; [laughs]</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Where did you head to next?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I had written a play for my final project at school. I did this play in New Orleans for the summer after graduation. During that time, I was like, &#8220;I just want to be a standup comedian and I want to write.&#8221; It&#8217;s a good decision in retrospect, but when you say that, there&#8217;s just a trillion things you don&#8217;t know. I moved back with my mom in Chicago and did open mics and shows in Chicago.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> When is it that you left Chicago?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> In 2000 I moved out to LA. I did the Chicago Comedy Festival in &rsquo;99. I got a manager out in LA and I decided I&#8217;d better come out and see what the wonderful world of entertainment held for me.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Was it because you had a manager in LA that you went there?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I was gonna go to New York, but I had friends in New York and had visited, and I thought, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m hard enough for that place.&#8221; I&#8217;d been out to LA when I was 10. That was the only other time I&#8217;d been out there. I had fond memories of it, and I thought, &#8220;Why not go out to LA; it&#8217;s sunny as hell.&#8221; I wish I went to New York because the standup scene out there is so amazing and inspiring. But if things weren&#8217;t going well with the industry out here, I just went into my head and started writing what I wanted. That&#8217;s a great benefit.</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Throughout all these travels that you had, what were some of the things that were influencing the development of your comedic sensibility?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I&#8217;d always been reading plays, and re-reading plays. A lot of that. A lot of older movies. </p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> What do you think of the term &#8220;alternative comedy&#8221;?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I&#8217;ve been frustrated by it a little. Some network had a file on me, and it just said: &#8220;Mike O&#8217;Connell: Alternative Comic.&#8221; What does that mean? That sounds bad, if that&#8217;s the only thing you know about me. But it&#8217;s just people treating the medium creatively, which should be under the umbrella of comedy, because every medium grows. It&#8217;s an easy way to group something that&#8217;s unfamiliar. People love that. [laughs]</p>

<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> You were named <em>Rolling Stone</em>&#8217;s Hot Comic of 2005. How did that come about?</strong></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">MO</strong> I decided to go out to New York and do a bunch of shows. A friend of mine got me a show at Joe&#8217;s Pub. A guy from <em>Rolling Stone</em> was there and thought I was good enough for that moniker. That was great. It helped me get on Kimmel, helped me get going.</p>


<p><strong><span class="allcaps blue space">TOP</span> Have you found that humor, and your humor in general, is a useful tool to help you make sense of things?</strong></p>
