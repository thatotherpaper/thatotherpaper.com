<p>When you ask an entrepreneur what the foundation of a successful business is, he doesn&#8217;t often answer marital problems. But marital problems are what spurred Mehtab Benton and his wife, Guru Karam Benton, into renewing their yoga practices and eventually opening a yoga studio. Now, with four locations, over 100 employees, and a happy marriage, the two have found nirvana.
</p>


<p>
I met up with Mehtab Benton at the Yoga Yoga location on Anderson and Burnet. I had never been inside a yoga studio before and didn&#8217;t know what to expect. What I found was a cozy, inviting, open reception area and about 30 people in loose clothes clutching yoga mats and chatting happily. Class had just gotten out, so I sat down to wait for the crowd to clear a bit and to observe the yoga students.
</p>

<p>
The American perception of yoga is that it&#8217;s for young people, mostly women, who want great yoga butts and superhuman flexibility. What I saw in the studio couldn&#8217;t have defied that expectation more. There were men and women ranging in age from early 20s to late 60s. Some were lean and strong; others were heavier. But they all had one thing in common: They were glowing from the yoga class they&#8217;d just done. &#8220;Wow,&#8221; I overheard one woman say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m okay to drive home after that.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
I eventually found Mehtab in the sea of people. He is a tall, thin man with long, flowing white hair, a beard to match, and a quick and easy laugh. Mehtab is his yoga name, a name that a yogi gives you when you begin your practice. (His wife&#8217;s yoga name is Guru Karam.) We went into one of the classrooms to talk. We were both in bare feet &#8211; they made me take my shoes off at the front door because it shows respect and helps to keep the floor clean &#8211; sat cross-legged facing each other on blankets on the teacher&#8217;s platform, and talked about how he came to found Yoga Yoga.
</p>

</div>


<p>
The Bentons&#8217; problem was all-too-common: After 15 or 20 years, they had become complacent with themselves, each other, and their lives. The ancient yogis teach that every seven, eleven, and eighteen years, a major change occurs in everyone&#8217;s lives, and Mehtab and Guru Karam had hit one of those junctures. &#8220;It just got to the point where we knew that we ourselves had to make a change,&#8221; Mehtab says. &#8220;In a relationship or in anything, you have two choices: Either you grow or you die.&#8221; It was a chance to either change or keep doing the same things that weren&#8217;t working for them, or to change in order to save their marriage. They chose to change.
</p>


<p>
Their answer was not expensive therapy; instead, they turned to yoga. Mehtab had practiced yoga years ago, before it became so popular &#8211; &#8220;pre-Madonna and pre-Oprah,&#8221; as he says &#8211; and loved it. &#8220;A lot of times in moments of crisis or pain or transition, you tend to want to go back to something that worked for you in the past,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;For us, it was yoga.&#8221; It gave them something to learn and do together, and it helped them grow together instead of apart.</p>
<p>
Unorthodox, certainly. But it worked. &#8220;Yoga gave us the balance and perspective to take a step in the right direction,&#8221; says Mehtab. &#8220;Yoga helped us get well. And once you get well, it&#8217;s required that you help other people get well.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
The Bentons decided to begin teaching yoga. But all they had to offer was some know-how and an extra bedroom in their house that could fit eight people. So they cleared out the extra room and put an ad in the yellow pages. Yoga-doers responded enthusiastically to finally having a yoga community in Austin. &#8220;We&#8217;d have all these complete strangers coming up to our house, knocking on our door, and saying, &#8216;Hey, can we do yoga here?&#8217; You can invite a stranger into your home, but they don&#8217;t normally remain a stranger very long.&#8221; The strangers who came to do yoga became friends. &#8220;We realized, &#8216;Hey, this is pretty powerful,&#8217;&#8221; says Mehtab.
</p>

<p>
Soon more people than would fit in the bedroom were coming to their house to do yoga, so the Bentons decided to open a studio. They weren&#8217;t sure exactly how that would work, but they did know one thing: The place they chose absolutely had to foster the same sense of community that was in their home. &#8220;We wanted the place to have the feel of our extra bedroom, but opened up to the public in a way.&#8221;</p>

<p>
In 1998, they opened their first studio, the South Lamar location, on a credit card. The first thing they had to do was think of a name. They wanted something that incorporated the sense of community as well as a sense of fun. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we decided to call our studio Yoga Yoga, because it was sort of like &#8216;pizza pizza.&#8217; You can&#8217;t really take yourself too seriously when you say it. It&#8217;s about being an adjective and a noun, about being really yoga, being yoga yoga.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Another of their immediate challenges was that neither of them knew much about how to run a business. Mehtab knew a little, but he soon realized that they needed someone business-savvy to help them or the new business would collapse. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t coming into this with the idea of it being a business; we just wanted to teach yoga,&#8221; says Mehtab. But that wasn&#8217;t enough, so they recruited another partner to help with the business side of things. When their first partner eventually moved to Phoenix to teach, they brought Rich Goldstein, a former student, on board, especially since so much of business was being conducted on computers by that point. &#8220;It was good to have someone come in who knew how to set up bank accounts and do spreadsheets and hire teachers and do the things you have to do to spread yoga around.&#8221;
</p>


<p>
It paid off. Although Yoga Yoga&#8217;s expansion has been slow, it&#8217;s been sure. The Bentons have gone from teaching eight people in a bedroom to teaching thousands of people a week. But they&#8217;re very careful not to violate their business philosophies. Mehtab sees no conflict between being serviceable, spiritual, and businesslike. &#8220;You can be a good businessperson and still be a very spiritual person. In fact, businesspeople should be spiritual, and spiritual people should be businesslike because it will allow them to be more successful.&#8221; People often approach the Bentons wanting to open franchises, but they always say no. &#8220;We have to keep the heart in this business,&#8221; Mehtab says. &#8220;Why would we dilute that? You can&#8217;t manufacture the sense that when you walk in, it feels like home, like it&#8217;s your place to be.&#8221;

<p>
Yoga Yoga has made it possible for people to actually have careers in yoga, which was unheard-of before. Location has a lot to do with it. &#8220;Austin is probably the perfect place for us to be,&#8221; says Mehtab. &#8220;It&#8217;s accepting of all lifestyles and it&#8217;s very supportive of people who choose their own path.&#8221; Austin has definitely treated Yoga Yoga well &#8211; the entire business is word-of-mouth. They&#8217;ve never advertised, yet have expanded to four locations and employ over 100 people part-time and full-time. They have people as young as 18 and as old as 70 training to be yoga teachers, they have children as young as five taking classes, and they have classes on subjects ranging from pre- and post-natal yoga to back therapy.</p>

<p>
&#8220;Some of our customers are the people who came to our house 10 years ago,&#8221; says Mehtab. &#8220;People come here and make friends, fall in love, have babies. Some of our customers who were single when they started coming here have had children, and now their children are coming here to do yoga.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
As much as the sense of community and down-to-earth philosophies of the founders have to do with Yoga Yoga&#8217;s success, Mehtab firmly believes that the power of yoga itself as a life-transforming force is what makes his business a success. &#8220;This yoga stuff has been going on for literally thousands of years,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Why have people been doing it for so long? Because it works. It was really the original holistic health care system &#8211; it was the way people developed to take care of their bodies.&#8221; And it works so well, he claims, that after doing yoga for four to six weeks, you will absolutely notice a change in how you feel physically, mentally, and emotionally.
</p>

<p>
The reason yoga is so transformative is stress, he says. Stress underlies most physical ailments and a significant number of psychological ones. Yoga is the number-one stress reducer in the world, so once the stress is gone, he says, you&#8217;ll stop doing things you may have never noticed you did before &#8211; be easily irritated, yell at loved ones, feel depressed. It also boosts your immune system so you rarely get sick. &#8220;But the main thing is to just do it,&#8221; Mehtab says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t just listen to me or read a book or hear somebody talk about it. Just come and do it. If you do it, it will work. It doesn&#8217;t ask you to give up anything, it doesn&#8217;t ask you to give your allegiance to any teacher, guru, or way of thought. All it asks you is to discover who you really are. And once you do that, you will be healthy and happy and whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mehtab smiles at me from across the tape recorder. &#8220;It&#8217;s unusual to get to do what you love in life, and it&#8217;s unusual to do something that helps people&#8217;s lives in such a particular way. I&#8217;m very grateful for this gift. I can honestly say that yoga saved my life.&#8221;
