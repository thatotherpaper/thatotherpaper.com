<p class="i">I first saw Ryan Stout perform at a small coffee shop a few days before he taped a <span class="noem">Live at Gotham</span> set for Comedy Central. On stage, Ryan was personable, charming, and delivering the sort of jokes that made the audience laugh in such a way you could tell they weren&#8217;t sure if it was appropriate to laugh, but they just couldn&#8217;t help it. Skillfully worded and delivered, Ryan&#8217;s material proclaimed he was a talent to watch in the years to come. Watch out America, here comes Ryan Stout!</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">That Other Paper</strong> How long have you been headlining?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Ryan Stout</strong> I&#8217;ve headlined here and there for the past two years. <a href="cityguide/cap_city_comedy_club.html">Cap City</a> was the first place to push me to do more time. Everywhere else went, &#8220;We&#8217;d love to have you come back and headline. You think you wanna do that?&#8221; Headlining shows is a lot of pressure. You have to put butts in seats and it&#8217;s more fun for me to go in as a feature, do some new material and dick around, and have it be fun and easy. Everyone wants to be a headliner, but it&#8217;s not the easiest thing in the world. Cap City brought me back to co-headline and this time around they&#8217;re flat out having me headline. They&#8217;re sick and tired of me coming in and playing games. They just want me to go in and do some work, and I&#8217;m more than happy to do that for them.</p>

</div>


<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> How has your material changed with time?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">RS</strong> I was trying to do then what I&#8217;m doing now, but due to lack of confidence and experience it wasn&#8217;t playing that well. I hadn&#8217;t developed my voice or demeanor, so it was a lot of audience members going, &#8220;Why is this kid being mean like that?&#8221; It was difficult, but that&#8217;s starting off. I find it fun to lie to the audience, press their buttons more, and say things I don&#8217;t mean. When you don&#8217;t have any comedic experience, and you&#8217;re doing that stuff, it doesn&#8217;t come across the way you want it to sometimes. Hopefully I&#8217;m getting better at it.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> When did you develop your interest in comedy?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">RS</strong> I watched a lot of stand-up as a kid, especially A&E&#8217;s <em>Evening at the Improv</em>. I must&#8217;ve been nine years old watching it at nine o&#8217;clock on Wednesday nights. My bedtime was nine and I stayed up for an hour past that to watch all the stand-up I wanted. I watched it a lot on Comedy Central, too. I preferred stand-up to sketch. I choose stand-up over <em>Monty Python</em> and <em>Kids in the Hall</em>, even though I think they&#8217;re very funny.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> When did you decide to make stand-up your career?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">RS</strong> I did my first set on my 17<sup>th</sup> birthday at a high school talent show. As soon as I started doing it, I was pretty much trying to figure out how to do it as a business. I knew early on that there were people who toyed with it as a hobby and did it for years and years, and I certainly didn&#8217;t want to be one of those people. I wanted to develop an act, be on TV, get paid, and not have to worry about going to a stupid day job.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What sort of day jobs have you worked in the past?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">RS</strong> I lucked out. My first day in the Bay area I wandered into a piano store and an old guy with no front teeth was trying to sell me a piano. I told him, &#8220;I don&#8217;t play the piano. I just like pianos. I like the way they sound. I&#8217;m fascinated when people can play pianos, but I have no talent whatsoever. I don&#8217;t even have a place to put a piano.&#8221; And he said he was looking for an assistant. I started cleaning up the store. Some days I&#8217;d just come in and read a book and that&#8217;d be my whole day. After September 11<sup>th</sup>, no one was really buying anything. The piano business got a little slow, and they didn&#8217;t have the money to keep me around, so I went back to school. I did stand-up every night I was at San Francisco State University. I spent years doing that, made the connections that I needed to start going out on the road, and I haven&#8217;t had another day job since 2001.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> Have you had any hell gigs in that time?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">RS</strong> I performed at a corporate gig for a group of retired, Republican men. I didn&#8217;t know they were Republicans until I got there, and the guy who booked me mentioned, &#8220;Yup, last Democrat we had here got strung up out back.&#8221; The gig was in a hunting lodge that had no stage, florescent lights, and a shoddy sound system. It was the only show I&#8217;ve ever done where men yelled at me because I was too loud while other men simultaneously yelled at me because they couldn&#8217;t hear me. They heckled and booed the whole time. The next night I had to do a show for their wives.</p>

<p>Compared to many comics, I haven&#8217;t done that much roadwork. Since I started in San Francisco, I was fortunate that I could get a lot of stage time in and around the Bay Area. So even though I&#8217;ve had a lot of little annoyances on the road, none have been big enough to complain about. Like after killing a Saturday late show at a club in Philadelphia, I was in the green room receiving fellatio from these redheaded, D-cup triplets. I reached for a bottle of water, only to discover we had run out of Fiji. All they had left was Crystal Geyser. Yuck.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What sort of impact did your college career have on your stand-up?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">RS</strong> I was pretty much a prick in college. I&#8217;d look around at people who were studying and didn&#8217;t really know what they wanted to do with their lives. They thought that maybe school would tell them. I would sit there, roll my eyes, and think, &#8220;I already know what I want to do, everybody. Can we please stop wasting my time?&#8221; I begrudgingly did all the work, kept a high GPA, and continued to do stand-up every night.</p>

<p>I found myself writing a lot of material in my critical thinking philosophy classes. A lot of my material toys with logic and is logic-based. Those classes really made me think more and more about certain subjects. I wish I could go back and do college all over again as a philosophy major. I was a creative writing major because I thought that would be easy. I dropped out with two classes left and moved to LA. College is done.</p>

<p class="b"><strong class="allcaps blue space">TOP</strong> What do you like to do when you&#8217;re in Austin?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">RS</strong> I have friends who still live there and I really like to hang out with them. I eat Mexican food a lot when I&#8217;m in Austin because it&#8217;s similar to the food I grew up on in El Paso. I like going to the <a href="cityguide/alamo_drafthouse_cinemas.html">Alamo Drafthouse</a> and having a meal while watching a movie. I&#8217;d never done that until I was in Austin. I&#8217;m not a big bar-hopping fan. I always do the <a href="cityguide/the_velveeta_room.html">Velveeta Room</a> open mic whenever I&#8217;m in town because I think it&#8217;s great to see the other comics and meet the people who are in the Austin scene.</p>
