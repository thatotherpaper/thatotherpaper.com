<p>The streets of South Congress seemed extraordinarily deserted for a Saturday. I postulated that the cold weather might be keeping people indoors &#8211; the sky was rife with thick, brooding clouds, and the brisk air hissed past the windows of my car. But as I approached the pulsing mob that had congregated outside Home Slice Pizza for the carnival celebrating its first year of operation, their disquieting shrieks assailing the assuring impenetrability of my SUV, I realized that this was simply the only game in town. Once I passed the boundary of that concession booth and exchanged American dollars for Pizza Currency, I was the kind of guy that attended Pizza Carnivals. I had to spend some time in my parked car becoming okay with that.</p>

<p>The scope of the Pizza Carnival took me by surprise. Real Ale ran a booth selling keg beer, Home Slice employees took turns reading “pizza fortunes” as the Great Calzone, and a caricature artist volunteered her feedback on the size of attendees’ teeth, noses, and foreheads. All of these activities were available for tickets that could be purchased at the front gate. At $.50 each, eight tickets for a cup of Fireman’s #4 seemed like a decent adult answer to the moonwalk.</p>

<p>The carnival’s live entertainment was also diverse in nature and appeal. Home Slice had invited employees from various pizza restaurants in Austin to compete in a dough-tossing contest: A crust-sculptor from the <a href="cityguide/mellow_mushroom.html">Mellow Mushroom</a> on Guadalupe won the title. The headlining act was the World Pizza Team, a group of pie-performers that has appeared on <em>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</em> and <em>Good Morning America</em>. Their acrobatics impressed the crowd and whet its appetite for diversion, but the idling pizza enthusiasts were clearly waiting for the main event. I could see anticipation in the eyes of the onlookers as they watched the nimble dough dance in the crisp December air, and a current of tension began coursing throughout the anxious herd. The World Pizza Team grew nervous, fearing that the crowd’s goodwill had evaporated. Watches were eyed. Yawns were let fly. A small child tugged at his father’s shirt sleeve and asked, pithily, “Is it time?”</p>

<p>This crowd had come to see the competitions.</p>

<p>The Hand on an Eggplant Sub challenge required contestants to affix one hand to an eggplant sandwich and keep it there for as long as possible. The spectacle was located on the sidewalk in front of Home Slice Pizza, and the participants ranged from war-hardened Vietnam veterans to wild-eyed beat poets to PhD-holding professors of medieval literature. Actually, that’s a lie &#8211; each translucent hand on the sub belonged to a 20-something hipster. I assumed that they were participating to satisfy their nearly-expired New Year’s resolutions of competing for something other than a crush’s heart.</p>

<p>The pizza-eating contest was the real draw of the Carnival. Nine participants gorged heroically in the waning sunlight of the day, each hoping to stuff their stomach full of more grease, cheese, and bread than anyone else in 30 minutes. The crowd was uproarious, and for good reason: The winner of this challenge would walk away with a year’s supply of Home Slice pizza.</p>

<p>Two parallel tables housed the contestants, with the four participants at the rear table looking down on their peers from an elevated platform. The height of the second table soon became symbolic: The decorated gluttony-veterans of the back row quickly left their floor-level counterparts in their dust. After only a few minutes the contest had become focused on three people, all at the back table: Chris, who claimed to have once eaten two pounds of chicken-fried steak in eight minutes; Sarah, the darling of the crowd; and Clay, a dark horse contender whose presence could only be attributed to a love of pizza.</p>

</div>


<p>Each member of the Trio of Terror had a different strategy. Chris cut his pizza up into tiny, bite-sized pieces and ate them by the handful. Sarah took a bite from one piece and moved onto the next, rotating the pizza within its box. Clay stuffed himself stoically, treating each piece of pizza as an individual achievement and maintaining his focus when Chris, the showboat, appealed to the crowd.</p>

<p>Sarah stalled at the half and dropped out of contention. The race was down to Chris and Clay, and I’m not ashamed to say that I supported Clay. Chris was brash and cocky, standing intermittently to taunt the spectators and remind the other contestants that he was ahead. I never doubted Chris’ skill as a glutton &#8211; two pounds of fried beef in eight minutes is an accomplishment I’d be proud to share with total strangers whom I’d never see again &#8211; but past performance means nothing in an eating contest. Sure, Chris was entertaining and knew how to work the crowd, but I resented his braggadocio and arrogant demeanor. A person can still exhibit class while cramming his body to capacity with junk food in front of a crowd.</p>

<p>Clay was an average Joe &#8211; the kind of guy I’d want to watch a football game with if I weren&#8217;t disgusted by the sight of someone gorging himself on multiple pizzas. Clay wasn’t out for glory; in fact, he seemed content in simply showcasing excess in public. But there was a sadness about Clay that can’t be overlooked &#8211; he sat stonefaced, the emotion in his eyes concealed by a pair of sunglasses on a dreary, overcast day. Clay intrigued me; I wondered where he had been before the contest, and where he’d wander to afterwards. Perhaps Clay was orphaned at a young age and learned to fend for himself on the streets. Had he ever loved, or were his first dates always ruined when he ordered multiple entrees and eschewed the use of silverware? When I looked at Clay’s empty pizza boxes and the pride in his form, I didn’t ask “how much” &#8211; I asked why.</p>

<p>The contest ended at five o&#8217;clock and the judges deliberated. Sarah was quickly awarded third place, having been the only person aside from Clay and Chris to start a second pizza. The judges didn’t immediately announce the second place winner, however, and were clearly engaged in discussion over who took first. Chris had been in the lead all along, but perhaps Clay had overcome him without fanfare. One judge suggested weighing the two contestants’ remaining slices. Was it that close? I waited with bated breath for the announcement that Clay had won. The entire crowd was in suspense; the strained heartbeat of a contestant in the front row erratically punctuated the hushed air.</p>

<p>Local comedian Jerm Pollet, the MC of the event, broke the bad news: Chris had won by a margin of 5/8 of a slice. I was crushed, but more than disappointed, I was worried about Clay. How would he handle this devastating loss? As a barrage of fair-weather fans deluged Chris, who pumped his fists wildly into the air in celebration, I approached Clay to offer him my condolences.</p>

<p>“Tough break, man,” I consoled, reaching for a slice of pizza from an unopened box. He didn’t respond. With the same stolid expression he wore throughout the contest, Clay walked companionless into the dusk and started for home. The setting sun cast his shadow onto the pavement of the parking lot behind him, and, as he turned the corner onto South Congress, I swear I saw it crack a smile.</p>

<p>For one, there was no Anna in the pizza pie eating contest&#8230;her name is Sarah and she, as the only woman in the contest was spoken about as a fierce competitor.  She ate one full pizza plus three more slices.</p>
<p>As for the eggplant sub contest&#8230;maybe only half of the contestants were hipsters.  There was Lexi, is a sixth grader and her mom was also in the contest and decided to pull out to do some Christmas shopping while Lexi was holding the sub.  Her Dad came to supervise. Other  people who entered the contest was a girl who dropped out in the first 30 minutes.  Then Elizabeth, who held on for three hours and 23 minutes.  The two die hard true competitors were Jen and Kyle.  Jen wanted the IPOD nano and Kyle just wanted the title.  At one point Kyle exclamed &#8220;It is not about the Ipod, I just love sandwiches&#8221;  The event ended at 2:45 in the morning when Terry the owner along with Nano one of the home slice employees announced that both had won and would receive ipods.</p>

<div class="picture"><img src="../files/pictures/picture_default.gif" alt="Anonymous&#039;s picture" title="Anonymous&#039;s picture"  /></div><div class="content"><p>I was at the Home Slice eating contest as a supporter of the arrogant show-boater, Chris.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that he is a prodigous eater. He is a true freak of nature to be feared at any eating contest. He did eat two pounds of chicken fried steak&#8230;but in his humility, he neglected to mention the two large bowls of gravy that he took down as well.</p>
<p>He loves to eat. He does it for the love of the game. That explains his enthusiastic demeanor during the contest. He was simply trying to get the crowd (and his large group of friends) fired up and laughing. </p>
<p>How often does an average Joe like Chris get to be up on stage in front of a large crowd doing something that he loves? If being excited and demonstrative is wrong in this situation, then I don&#8217;t want to be right.</p>

<div class="picture"><img src="../files/pictures/picture_default.gif" alt="Anonymous&#039;s picture" title="Anonymous&#039;s picture"  /></div><div class="content"><p>while clay did launch an unremarkable rally-attempt in the final five minutes he did not set himself apart from the other amateur-hour eaters in the event, not by a longshot.  clay represents all that was mediocre (besides the newyorkability of this particular pizza brand) on south congress that day.  </p>
<p>the crowd enjoyed the contest but clay was never a focus of anyone&#8217;s attention or even mild interest - he may have been second in volume, but he was 2nd to last in watchability - i&#8217;ll rank the contestants here from least winning to most:</p>
<p>9. JSG in a P- Just Some Guy in a Plaidshirt - bottom right, regular kind of boring -medium fratty- not much of an eater despite his solid girthiness  (maybe the type of guy eric seufert would like to watch nascar with&#8230; i dunno).</p>
<p>8. clay - he stood and sometimes made faces like he knew he would later be sick - which he was&#8230;</p>
<p>7. aggie hair - bottom left - clearly regretted his entry into the event. cheese and sauce mixed with the general unease in his belly that day&#8230; </p>
<p>6. red stripe - next to clay -  was interesting only in his apparent lack of interest in this contest &amp; in even getting his $10 worth of bellyfill.  didn&#8217;t give much thought to whole thing is my guess &#8212; less than eric seufert has &#8212; less than i have.</p>
<p>5. oliver-from-the-brady-bunch, bottom center - he balanced out his obvious outmatchedness with unconvincing head-bobbing a la the roxbury&#8230; his enthusiasm to ability ratio was way off and that was sad b/c somewhere in the crowd was a girl who was convincing herself that she really wasn&#8217;t going to ever sleep with him again&#8230;again.  he also looked like the human version of Simon (the be-spectacled Chipmunk) by the end - it was the puffy cheeks.</p>
<p>4. double-up - between oliver and JSG - this guy demanded our attention only b/c through guile and cunning he constantly tricked the crowd into believing he was more of a threat than he actually was.   his double slice stacking technique (he was inverted) was maybe a ploy to trick himself into a false sense of accomplishment - he was ultimately unsuccesful in nearly every way, but he drew the intent eyes of the crowd even at the end. at times thought to be the dark horse&#8230; by people who were wrong.</p>
<p>3. chris - champ, top left - best position, best technique, best stamina - he definitely won by more than 5/8ths (i got in there and checked it) and indeed they should&#8217;ve weighed the final boxes at which point there&#8217;s no doubt his win would&#8217;ve been more decisive&#8230; chris&#8217;s performance, both sporting &amp; enthusiastic, was far from arrogant - it seems eric seufert misunderstands eat-athletic precision and confident control of an eager crowd in need of some form of leadership with the negatives he shit-talked above&#8230; if anything, i would say that chris exuded wholesomeness, hence his 3rd place watchability rating.</p>
<p>2. sarah - next to chris - an underdog with feline charms. she was dismissed by many, seen as a token perhaps, maybe better-suited to the eggplant contest in the eyes of some, but those some are real dumb.  she was a firecracker, a sparkplug, the darling of the top tier. she proved herself a true queen of pies that day. home slice has 99 problems but sarah wasn&#8217;t one. high high watchability factor.</p>
<p>and the #1 most watchable:</p>
<p>1. homeless - between aggie hair and oliver - homeless (aka blackbeard) was the real winner here.  after a long day flagging for quarters at the corner of 35&amp;oltorf homeless managed to put together the $10 entry fee. shoulders hunched over, eyes darting left and fro, he tensed his distended belly and set about to take in his only planned meal between then and xmas at the riverside soup kitchen.  he was the most watchable only b/c you&#8217;d be a fool to take your eyes off this swarthy character just as likely to shiv you with a rusty butterfly knife as he was to burn through some mgd and rocks under the overpass&#8230; maintaining his composure he mixed in with the other unshaved and dirty hipsters but he had noone fooled, well maybe some. </p>
<p>and that&#8217;s the breakdown down there.</p>
