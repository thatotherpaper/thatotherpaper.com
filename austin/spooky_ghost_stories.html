<p class="i">Dear Mom,</p>

<p class="i">Why wouldn&#8217;t you let me be a robot for Halloween? Now I&#8217;m a serial killer who watches girls in the shower. Here are some stories I wrote for you on the fifth anniversary of your unexplained murder.</p>

<h2>Skate or Die</h2>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it gonna be? Skate or die?&#8221;</p>

<p>This is how he always imagined it would be.</p> 

<p>He stood still for a minute, only moving to wipe the sweat off his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Skate!&#8221; he shouted. He jumped on his board and flew down the half-pipe.</p> 

<p>Later, when he got on the city bus to go home, he noticed the man next to him was staring at his skateboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice board,&#8221; said the man, coughing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame the skate park burned down three years ago.&#8221;</p>


<h2>The Home-Run Butcher</h2>

<p>It was a dark and stormy night, and little Matty Stevenson-Robertson had hit his first home run at the Big Game earlier that day. Proud of his boy, Matty&#8217;s father patted him on the back and told him to go upstairs to his room and put on a coat &#8211; they were going to town to buy the finest steaks the butcher had to offer.</p> 

<p>&#8220;Hello there, Matty! Heard &rsquo;bout your home run at the Big Game today! My, what a game-winning play!&#8221; the butcher said as Matty and his father walked into the old store. &#8220;Must be proud of your boy,&#8221; he continued, nodding at Mr. Stevenson-Robertson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir!&#8221; cried Matty, his brown eyes twinkling in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, save your thank-yous for this,&#8221; said the butcher, turning around to go to the back of the store. He returned moments later carrying the head of a jackal. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been saving this for a winner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t possibly accept&#8211;&#8221; said Mr. Stevenson-Robertson, putting out his arms in protest.</p> 

<p>&#8220;Dad! Please?&#8221; said Matty. &#8220;He said it was for a winner, and that&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p>Matty and his father accepted the butcher&#8217;s gift of the jackal head and returned home, where Mrs. Stevenson-Robertson and Matty&#8217;s 17 brothers were boiling water in the kitchen. When Mrs. Stevenson-Robertson saw what her husband carried into their home, she turned pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got it from the butcher!&#8221; exclaimed Matty. &#8220;For free! Because I&#8217;m a winner!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevenson-Robertson sat in silence for a moment, staring at the head, before she said, &#8220;But the butcher burned down three years ago.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Best Week Ever</h2>

<p>Last week, Jason was having the best week ever. He scored front-row tickets to Lifehouse, and, best of all, he found a $1 bill on the ground. But yesterday when Jason told his best friend that he had the best week ever, his friend replied, &#8220;That week burned down three years ago.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Hot Times</h2>

<p>&#8220;You look fat in those pants,&#8221; Sam said to his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Telling me that doesn&#8217;t hurt anymore,&#8221; said his wife.  &#8220;My self-esteem burned down three years ago.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Time Machine</h2>


<p>The blueprints weren&#8217;t checked before Dr. Heingold Zildebottom built his fabled time machine. He had included all the necessary parts: wing of bat, tongue of frog, flux capacitor borrowed from the set of <em>Back to the Future</em>, other wing of a different bat &#8211; the usual.</p>

<p>But he forgot the critical ingredient: the fireproofing balm. This balm would prevent the massive flames that shot out of the machine upon use from melting the weak alloys upon contact. He had written &#8220;Buy fireproofing balm&#8221; right after &#8220;Pick up short-term amnesia medicine&#8221; on his list of things to do; nobody knows why he didn&#8217;t include it in the final prototype.</p>

<p>Deciding to test the machine with a reasonable jump, rather than propelling himself thousands of years either way, he set the machine to shoot him three years into the future. All went well, but upon arriving at his lab in the future his machine was missing. He asked his assistant, &#8220;Jules, where is my machine!?&#8221;</p>

<p>His assistant responded gravely, &#8220;It burned down three years ago.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Hot Times Part II</h2>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think that table will look good in our living room,&#8221; Amanda said spoiledly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What living room?&#8221; her husband said.  &#8220;Our marriage burned down three years ago.&#8221;</p>


<h2>Young Love</h2>

<p>Two teenagers were engaging in a little hanky-panky one night in the car, and they heard on the radio that a madman was on the loose.</p>

<p>&#8220;This one-armed lunatic can be identified by the rusty hook that has taken the place of his right hand,&#8221; said the man on the radio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you turn that off, Henry?&#8221; asked Sally Gustafson as she wiped her mouth. &#8220;It&#8217;s kinda scaring me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever,&#8221; remarked Henry, the high school quarterback, as he fumbled for the Off switch. The radio went silent.</p>

<p>As they continued to clumsily fondle each other&#8217;s genitals through damp clothing, they heard a strange sound.</p>

</div>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that noise, Henry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you, a prude?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I just&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This thing ain&#8217;t gonna suck itself,&#8221; said Henry as he pulled a lollipop from the center console.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ooh, grape!&#8221; Sally beamed. &#8220;My favorite!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give it to you if you give me a blowjob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry fumbled at his zipper.</p>

<p><em>Ohmigod ohmigod</em>, he thought. His skin was suddenly clammy. His mouth was drying up. <em>Ohmigod, it&#8217;s finally gonna happen!</em></p>

<p>&#8220;HENRY!&#8221; Sally screamed.</p>

<p>Henry was so startled he nearly zipped up his balls.</p>

<p>&#8220;WHAT THE FUCK!&#8221; he screamed.

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; Sally was trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;NO! WHAT THE FUCK!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard a noise! It sounded like&#8230; like a scraping noise. Like someone trying to get into the car!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally squeezed Henry close.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so scared!&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry pushed her off.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shoulda listened to Joe,&#8221; he mumbled. &#8220;You&#8217;re as frigid as a&#8230; a&#8230;&#8221; He started the car. &#8220;I dunno. Fuck you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry slammed the car into drive and peeled out of the parking lot.</p>

<p>After a long, tense ride punctuated with muted sobs and desperate, whispered prayers, they arrived at Sally&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the blue balls,&#8221; spat Henry as he leaned across Sally&#8217;s lap, unlatched the door, and thrust it wide open. &#8220;Tomorrow I&#8217;m gonna tell everyone at school that you&#8217;re a lesbian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally wiped her eyes and stepped out of the car. As she turned to close the door, she saw something hanging from the handle. It looked heavy and metallic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; She sniffled and bent down to take a closer look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that?&#8221; asked Henry, annoyed. &#8220;That&#8217;s just the hook of that madman who escaped earlier tonight. He was trying to get in the car while I was fingering you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally&#8217;s face went white. She backed away from the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8230; but&#8230;&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; Henry rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But my vagina burned down three years ago!!!&#8221;</p>


<h2>Postmodern Ghost Story</h2>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I thought.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t be thinking &#8211; I burned down three years ago.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Werewolf Lane</h2>

<div class="image aligncenter clear" style="width: 500px;">

</div>


<p>When I was growing up there was this road called Werewolf Lane outside of town &#8211; in the deep green of rural east Texas.</p> 

<p>One of the oldest cemeteries in the region ran up the left side of the road. The cemetery was a couple of miles long and went back a ways and ran up against some woods &#8211; thick, black woods. On the right side there was a ditch and then more impenetrably black, tangled vegetation.</p> 

<p>On account of the foliage and the fact that the largest potential zombie population in east Texas inhabited that particular graveyard, there were a good number of people who worshiped the devil out there. In the woods, I mean.</p> 

<p>East Texas has more cults per capita than any other region in the country. Don&#8217;t know why.</p>

<p>Devil worshipers robbed the grave of a grand wizard from the KKK, as well as the graves of murderers, rapists, prominent businessmen, and so forth. The devil worshipers could gain evil powers from the bones by crushing them up and mixing them with Everclear and Kool-Aid.  The concoction lead the devil worshipers to commit unspeakable acts &#8211; like murdering children and putting kittens down in dirt holes and shooting them with shotguns. Devil worshiper stuff.</p>

<p>I even saw a true crime documentary about Werewolf Lane. In the documentary they called the road by its real name, Omen Road. But I knew it was the same road because of the way the devil worshipers had hung cat bones and empty milk cartons from the tangled canopy of trees arching above those unfortunate people who found themselves traveling that way.</p> 

<p>Based on the tip of some <a href="../blog/stephen_short/i_pranked_you_good.html">rural youth hunting deer out of season</a>, the investigators discovered this skeleton in the black, black woods. It was a female corpse without any hands or teeth. But after some extensive forensic analyses, they caught the devil worshiper that killed her. The devil worshiper wore large, thick glasses and had a thin, blond mustache. He showed little emotion at the trial. They put him to death for the way he killed her. I won&#8217;t go into that, though. But whenever the wind blows on Werewolf Lane you can hear her screaming and pleading for her life.</p> 

<p>And there was this other girl who lived in a trailer out on the edge of the woods near Werewolf Lane, and she had sex with a werewolf. And her boyfriend was awfully embarrassed. That he was a werewolf, I mean. She was all scratched up. There was no way for him to control the moon, you know? So he wrote her this letter. And I don&#8217;t know &#8211; but she let him turn her into a werewolf, too, because she loved him so much and he had hurt her like that when he was such a monster &#8211; so she wanted to be a monster, too. And everyone said the werewolf couple ran up and down Werewolf Lane having crazy werewolf sex on people&#8217;s graves and eating people&#8217;s brains. Werewolf stuff.</p>

<p>And we were all sleeping over at my parents&#8217; house. We didn&#8217;t have drivers licenses, but our buddy had a hardship license &#8211; so we all snuck out the laundry room window with a bottle of my parents&#8217; scotch and took off.</p>  

<p>Two people rode in the cab of the little Datsun truck and the rest of us were in the back. And so we were riding down the highway, into the blackness, and &#8220;Werewolves of London&#8221; by Warren Zevon was playing on the stereo. It was near Halloween and cold outside for the first time since summer. The air smelled like smoke and blood.</p> 

<p>We were headed out to see these girls: Ashley and her sister Helen and their four friends who were staying out at their farm with them. Ashley and Helen&#8217;s parents were in Brazil enjoying the weather, cuisine, and sexual practices of that country.</p> 

<p>And we took a left onto Werewolf Lane to get to the farm (it was a shortcut), and I mean none of us brought it up &#8211; what we were doing, driving down Werewolf Lane. We were just all quiet, hoping we&#8217;d survive the shortcut and score out at Ashley&#8217;s farm.</p>  

<p>Helen had told me that Ashley had pimples on her ass, and I couldn&#8217;t help thinking about that. But I didn&#8217;t say anything to anyone about it. I was just going to avoid Ashley.</p>

<p>So we pulled onto Werewolf Lane and we could hear the cat bones and empty milk cartons knocking together in the wind &#8211; like wood wind chimes, only not so resonant. It was foggy, and everyone tried to downplay their anxiety.</p> 

<p>But nothing really happened.</p> 

<p>Except we took a turn too sharp and fucked up the truck a little bit when we hit a post fence, on a road just off of Werewolf Lane. The farmer who owned the property had tied the carcass of a feral dog he&#8217;d shot to the fence post near where we hit, so no other dogs would think about killing his livestock. The carcass smelled like rotting death.</p> 

<p>But we made it out to the farm and played spin the bottle with Ashley and Helen and their friends. I avoided Ashley and made out with her sister Helen. I wrote Helen a poem right there on the spot. And Ashley was sad. The whole time I made out with Helen I thought about the werewolves having sex on people&#8217;s graves.</p>

<p>But anyway, some kids burned all the woods down three years ago. They weren&#8217;t devil worshipers or anything, just some kids cooking meth. Some people say the devil invented meth. I don&#8217;t know, though.</p> 

<p>It&#8217;s all suburbs out there now.</p>
