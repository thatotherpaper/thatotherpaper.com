<p class="i"><span class="noem">That Other Paper</span>â€™s Nicole Haddad and Adam Avramescu decided to listen to 54 Seconds&#8217; LP <span class="noem">Postcards from California</span> and record their thoughts in <a href="http://themadpigeon.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/bert_ernie.jpg">dialogue form</a>.</p>

<p>What we know: According to their press kit, 54 Seconds&#8217; lead singer Spencer Gibb is the son of the <a href="http://www.supermusic.sk/obrazky/6112_robin_gibb.jpg">Bee Gees&#8217; Robin Gibb</a>.  We have so many questions now!  Unlike his father, Spencer has been <strong>stayin&#8217; alive</strong> in Austin, and with this new album, he&#8217;s just <strong>gotta get a message to you</strong>.  There&#8217;re cute little Polaroids all over the album art, and the cover appears to be our formerly standing Intel shell, which just <a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/ADVG/389~Mini-Austin-Posters.jpg">screams Austin</a>.</p>

<h3>Track One: &#8220;Blocking the Sun&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Well, this is what a <a href="http://www.goingpostalt-shirts.com/PostCardT-shirts/Big/California.jpg">postcard from California</a> might sound like if committed to tape.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> How do you think a <a href="http://dalesdesigns.net/California350x244.jpg">postcard from California</a> would sound?  Distorted?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Apparently.  Sun-drenched guitars. Oh, what are you eating?  That looks good.  Is it good?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Not really.  It&#8217;s a <a href="http://shopping.msn.com/prices/shp/?itemId=20654956">meal-replacement bar</a>.  Chocolate-coconut.  Very coconutty.  I&#8217;ve never tried it before.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I like the little synth-y riff they&#8217;ve got running over the intro.  And I like the key change for the chorus, though I&#8217;m not so sure I like the synth farts running through the whole thing.  I think it takes a strong band to realize that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/lookaroundyou/images/music_synth_patel.jpg">synthesizers aren&#8217;t that interesting</a> on their own.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> They really aren&#8217;t.  Everybody&#8217;s using them now, though.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> You can thank <a href="http://www.therentals.com/2007/">The Rentals</a> for that.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I&#8217;d much rather listen to music that sounds like <a href="http://non.primate.net/images/accordion.jpg">real</a> <a href="http://media.cla.auburn.edu/music/images/AuburnTuba-EuphoniumQuartet2_450px.jpg">instruments</a> are playing.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Well, it&#8217;s not even that for me.  It&#8217;s just <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/428/000022362/rush-pubshot.jpg">needless extra noise</a>.  But aside from that, I think I like the sound of this.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> For me, a lot of my musical tastes are formed around the vocal quality.  I don&#8217;t really like the sound of his voice.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I don&#8217;t really listen to vocals, but I think this guy is okay.  Here&#8217;s that riff again, on guitar.  It&#8217;s a good riff &#8211; they&#8217;re overusing it, but it&#8217;s good. You look <a href="http://www.thesmokehammer.com/images/bush_head2.jpg">deep in thought</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I&#8217;m trying to decide if this is good or not.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> The song?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> No, my meal replacement bar.  It&#8217;s a bit chalky.  Too much coconut, not enough chocolate.</p>

<h3>Track Two: &#8220;Ben&#8217;s Letter&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> This track is called &#8220;Ben&#8217;s Letter.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> What, Ben?  Like <a href="http://z.about.com/d/lost/1/0/K/5/-/-/Ben.jpg">Ben from<em> Lost</em></a>?  I love <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index"><em>Lost</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I was thinking more of one of <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/images/keyword/180820.jpg">the Bens</a> &#8211; <a href="http://www.jasonchatfield.com/blog/images/20060827_benfolds4.jpg">Folds</a>, <a href="http://www.travelnotes.org/Oceania/images/australia_regions.gif">Lee</a>, or <a href="http://i.realone.com/assets/rn/img/1/2/0/6/11716021.jpg">Kweller</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> All the best people are named <a href="http://www.shout.net/~bigred/2bens.jpg">Ben</a>; have you noticed?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I don&#8217;t agree with that &#8211; hey!  This is a <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a> song.  This is &#8220;<a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Radiohead%20Lyrics/Bulletproof..%20I%20Wish%20I%20Was%20Lyrics.html">Bulletproof</a>.&#8221;  Same instrumentation, same progression, same melody.  I&#8217;m gonna try to listen to this and <a href="http://www.travisonline.com/">enjoy this despite the fact that it&#8217;s a Radiohead song</a>.  Because that wasn&#8217;t a great Radiohead song anyway.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve heard it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It&#8217;s pretty cool that they decided to put in a <a href="http://media.cla.auburn.edu/music/images/AuburnTuba-EuphoniumQuartet2_450px.jpg">brass section</a> here.  I also like the piano voicings.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This is a really nice, mellow song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Yeah, I can actually get into this.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This is on the verge of being a CD that I would sit next to my CD player and memorize.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It&#8217;s not there for me, but I think it&#8217;s well above background music.  It&#8217;s holding my attention.  And I think it&#8217;s because this band has a fairly good grasp of its instrumentation.  I think the synth in the last song was a <a href="http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/c/cd/180px-Misfire-slugslinger.jpg">misfire</a> and I think the synth pad here is a bit much, but overall&#8211;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> It sounds like a <a href="http://www.coldplay.com/">Coldplay</a> song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It&#8217;s not big enough to be a <a href="http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/msnbc/Sections/Newsweek/Components/Photos/Mag/050530_Issue/050521_Coldplay_hd.hlarge.jpg">Coldplay</a> song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> You mean not overproduced enough?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Coldplay <a href="http://fortes.com/2005/08/16/coldplay/coldplay.jpg">sounds like they&#8217;re in a stadium</a>, even on CD.  Maybe if there was tons more reverb and everything was <a href="http://www.thewhippinpost.co.uk/mixing-music/compression-audio-mixing.htm">compressed</a> to high hell, this would be a Coldplay song.  But everything&#8217;s a bit looser here.  More of a lounge feel.  The production is just a little smarter.  I just wish they had left out the synth pad.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I like this song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Me too.  This is gonna be <a href="http://www.cdbyme.com/images/Prom-jpeg.jpg">somebody&#8217;s prom song</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Some day.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Somebody will <a href="http://www.catalinasmbay.org/names/kidding.jpg">lose their virginity</a> to this song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Some day.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> <a href="http://sapporo-online.cool.ne.jp/00_diary_photo_box/Congratulations!_0907.jpg">Congratulations</a>, 54 Seconds.  You&#8217;re popping some cherries.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Like this is the song they&#8217;d play in a movie for the cherry-popping scene.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> You know, maybe, but I feel like the horns make this song smarter than that.  You wouldn&#8217;t think to put them in a song like this ordinarily.  It feels more genuine than a <a href="http://www.gardenstatesoundtrack.com/">movie soundtrack</a>.</p>

<h3>Track Three: &#8220;Dirty Little Secret&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> And here&#8217;s the single.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I really don&#8217;t want to eat any more of this.  It&#8217;s disgusting.  It took me five-sixths of the bar to make me realize I couldn&#8217;t eat any more.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Okay, let me try it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> You&#8217;re gonna be so freaked out that I ate that much of it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It is a little chalky, you&#8217;re right.  You&#8217;d be surprised at <a href="http://www.aakamilitary.com/images/fullsize/atf_delta_boot_300.gif">what</a> <a href="http://1800hart.com/picks/wp-content/NordicWinterTire.jpg">I&#8217;ll</a> <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome/images/hh0217s.jpg">eat</a>, though.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It&#8217;s called &#8220;Atkins Advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> All right, this song isn&#8217;t doing anything for me.  I would&#8217;ve preferred the last two for a single.  You know what it is? This band needs to <a href="http://www.carintech.com/posters/fired.jpg">let its synth player go</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Let&#8217;s see who the synth player is.  <a href="http://chriskline.com/images/stew.jpg">Stewart Cochran</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Oh, usually the girl plays keyboards.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> She actually plays bass and guitar.  <a href="http://darklight.co.za/files/musicbase/212.png">Girls who play bass</a> are kinda hot.  I always wanted to play drums, but I had to play flute.  I dated a guy in middle school who played the flute.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Did you turn him gay?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> No, he was already gay &#8211; he played the flute.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> You were just his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beard_(female_companion)">beard</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> No, I&#8217;m kidding.  He was straight.  And he broke up with me in my yearbook.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> He broke up with you in your yearbook?  Like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s see other people, HAGS&#8221;?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> No, &#8220;Hey, I think we should take a break for the summer.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> &#8220;HAGS.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> That&#8217;s what this song reminds me of &ndash; when my eighth grade boyfriend broke up with me in my yearbook.  It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.mandolincafe.com/archives/postcards/images/mandolin01.jpg">melancholy, lilting tones of the mandolin</a>.  Reminds me of my ex-boyfriend.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Reminds me of <a href="http://imagesource.allposters.com/images/pic/102/017~Captain-Corelli-s-Mandolin-Posters.jpg">Corelli</a>.  And how <a href="hhttp://www.thejay.com/2007/02/09/bad-nicolas-cage-movie/">Nicolas Cage needs a better agent</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Yeah, I mean, <a href="http://thecia.com.au/reviews/g/images/ghost-rider-poster-0.jpg"><em>Ghost Rider</em></a>?  Have you noticed how every time you go to the movie, that preview is playing?  Whether it&#8217;s the preview for the movie or the DVD, it&#8217;s always <a href="http://www.downloadwallpaper.de/hintergrundbilder/Film_hintergrundbilder/Ghost_Rider_3.jpg"><em>Ghost Rider</em></a>.</p>

<h3>Track Four: &#8220;I Wish I Was a Girl&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Hey, listen to that!  This is really good.  There was just a break for silence.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> There was a break!</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> There was no guitar for several seconds, just bass and drums.  This is good.  This band knows how to arrange a song.  It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/blogs/images/sfgate/techchron/2006/08/21/streaker.jpg">ballsy</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This song is called &#8220;I Wish I Was a Girl.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.joe-ks.com/archives_dec2004/KiltBlown.jpg">also ballsy</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=56958">I wish I was a girl</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I wish you were a girl, too, Nicole.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> After all I talked about how music is bought and sold with me in terms of the vocal quality, I very rarely like female singers.  I&#8217;m really picky.  But this girl [Rachel Loy] singing back-up is good.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I like Spencer&#8217;s voice, too.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> It&#8217;s growing on me.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I like how it sounds raspy and drug-addled.</p>

<p><a href="http://"><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Like <a href="http://www.ryan-adams.com/RyanAdams.html">Ryan Adams</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> He sounds like he should be singing in a grunge band, but he just showed up 15 years too late.  Pop is the new grunge, anyway.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Alt-pop-rock is the new grunge.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> You mean alt-pop-rock-indie-alt-pop-alt-alt.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Prock-ternative. Emo-core-ternative.  This is good &#8211; except for that fake ending.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> That was not a fake ending.  Although some bands do just end their songs abruptly like that when you think they&#8217;re going to continue.  But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a fake ending if you think they&#8217;re going to continue and then they do.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I didn&#8217;t think they were going to.  It&#8217;s a fake ending.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> You know, I like the synths in this song.  I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.catalinasmbay.org/names/kidding.jpg">reconsidering Stewart</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I like everything about this song, except the fake ending.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> There was no fake ending.  I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and disagree with you and say that the fake ending worked.</p>

<h3>Track Five: &#8220;California&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Oh, this is &#8220;California.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> This is another <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/index"><em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em></a> track.  I guess I&#8217;m okay with this, though.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I hate <a href="http://www.saynotocrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/greys_jump_shark.jpg"><em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Me too.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> It&#8217;s such a rip-off.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It&#8217;s a rip-off?  Do you pay for it?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> No, I mean it rips off <a href="http://www.nbc.com/ER/">every</a> <a href="http://www.fox.com/house/">other</a> <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/stelsewhere/stelsewhere.htm">hospital</a> <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/">show</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I think that&#8217;s why everyone likes it, though.  It&#8217;s a teen drama set at a hospital.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Whatever, it sucks.  And that chick &#8211; <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/060927/192934__meredith_l.jpg">the lispy one</a> &ndash; I hate her. I like <a href="http://www.buddytv.com/articles/greys_anatomy/images/Katherine_Heigl.jpg">Katherine Heigl</a>, though.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Katherine Heigl has done some legitimately good work outside of <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110612/"><em>My Father, the Hero</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118178/"><em>Wish Upon a Star</em></a>.  Or what was that show where she was an alien?  <a href="http://img.verycd.com/posts/0510/post-36686-1128922545.jpg"><em>Roswell</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This sounds like <a href="http://www.jamesblunt.com/">James Blunt</a>.  Not in a negative way.  Just if it was polished up a bit and sung by a <a href="http://www.transdiffusion.org/tmc/tvh/images/murielyoung.jpg">British pussy</a>.  I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean pussy.  British &#8211; man.  Who <a href="http://www.thefreshscent.com/wp-content/post_imgs/random_jamesblunt-petranemcova.jpg">sometimes sleeps with hot models</a>, apparently.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> He sleeps atop a bed of hot models.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> How does that happen?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94mC9JCLq-U">Ikea</a>.  He just has to put them together himself.  Yeah, these guys are definitely better when they&#8217;re rocking.  But I understand that if you&#8217;re a band in this position, you absolutely want to have as many <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em> tracks as possible.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> So you can get rich.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> And dip into high school kids&#8217; wallets.  Disposable income.  <a href="http://www.westlakehills.org/">Westlake</a> kids will buy this CD.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> If I ever made a CD, I would not let them sell it in Westlake.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> You&#8217;re putting that in the contract?  I would sell mine exclusively in Westlake.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> For $30 a CD.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> For $30 a song.  Each track will be 20 seconds long, and the CD will run an hour.  Doing the math?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I don&#8217;t know.  I wasn&#8217;t a math major!</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> That&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t multiply.  That&#8217;s all they teach you in the math major, really.  This track has gotten progressively more interesting.  I like this outro.  It&#8217;s kind of a build.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> What&#8217;s it building to?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I dunno, the end.  But I like it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> The entire band is sighing.  I kind of nothing that track.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I was okay with the ending.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I nothing it.</p>

<h3>Track Six: &#8220;My Crazy Life&#8221;</h3>
<p>
<strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> &#8220;Mi Vida Loca.&#8221;  Ugh, this meal bar.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> You wanna review the bar?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00008EY6Q.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg">It was bad</a>.</p>  

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> &#8220;Adam and Nicole review Nicole&#8217;s meal replacement bar.&#8221;  All right, what do you think of this track?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> He especially sounds like Ryan Adams now.  I like the drums a lot.</p>  

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Oh, there&#8217;s the kick-in.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I like really cliched drum structures.  I like <a href="http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textt/images/Timpani.jpg">other kinds of drums</a>, too, but I like when drums sound familiar.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I think a <a href="http://deerhoof.killrockstars.com/">really good band</a> can rise and fall on their drumming.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> So how do you feel about the drums on this track?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Not doing anything for me.  Like, a good drummer can take really cliched structures and own them.  Think of <a href="http://www.johnvanderslice.com/html/2002falltourphotos/jim_eno.html">Jim Eno</a>.  He just owns it.  Oh, there&#8217;s that stupid synth again.  <a href="http://www.aprilsmithmusic.com/myspace/you're%20fired!.bmp">Stewart&#8230;</a></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I don&#8217;t understand why everyone now thinks their songs have to sound like a video game or a cell phone ringtone.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It&#8217;s not even that.  It&#8217;s the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s nostalgia kick.  Because back then, people were using these sounds sincerely, just because they could.  Because they existed.  So now it&#8217;s cool to have synths even if you&#8217;re not using them for anything.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> So it&#8217;s like wearing <a href="http://www.onlyolivia.com/pix/80s/81_physical_98.jpg">leg warmers</a> or a <a href="http://www.ladyluckrulesok.com/journal/supersuperblog1.jpg">side-pony</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Here&#8217;s the sighs again.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> What&#8217;s that sound, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/lookaroundyou/series1/littlemouse.shtml">a mouse</a>?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Most likely.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> There&#8217;s something squeaky.  Is it a synth?  I mean &#8211; synths &#8211; haven&#8217;t you ever just been driving and you hear something in a song and you think, </em>Is that my ringtone?</em></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> That has never happened to me.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Not even once?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I know what my ringtone sounds like.  Sometimes I&#8217;ll be hearing a song and think I hear police sirens.  You know, I only think it&#8217;s my cell phone when <a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/David-Bowie/Queen-Bitch.html">the song that is my ringtone</a> plays.</p>

<h3>Track Seven: &#8220;How I Roll (Summer Version)&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I wonder if this song is a reference to <a href="http://play.rhapsody.com/pavement/slantedenchanted/summerbabewinterversion?didAutoplayBounce=true">Pavement</a>.  Okay, this is good, and I&#8217;m glad they picked up the pace.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> The last two were starting to drag.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Right, exactly.  I think that they could have done without the last song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I just feel like when you put two slow songs in a row like that, especially if they&#8217;re kind of dirgeful, it really slows the album down.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Yeah, it destroys the pace.  But I think a lot of bands just succumb to the temptation to put all the slow songs in the middle, so they can bring it back up later.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Like <a href="http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/">Jimmy Eat World</a>.  Jimmy Eat World&#8211;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Sucks.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Fuck you.  Jimmy Eat World has some rockin&#8217; songs, but on all their recent CDs, they have one slow song just smack-dab in the middle.  And it totally detracts from the rest of the album.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It can be pulled off, but it&#8217;s a cliche.  And I think that this song is far more interesting than what came before it.  Ooh, listen to these horns!  This is really good.  I think if you&#8217;re in a band, you should be forced to sign a contract that you can&#8217;t do a slow song unless it&#8217;s interesting.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> But who decides what&#8217;s interesting?  Is there an Interesting Committee?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Well, that&#8217;s the thing.  It&#8217;s more of a Ministry, actually.  It comes back to the idea that those slow songs that we just slept through will be <a href="http://www.gardenstatesoundtrack.com/">some high schooler&#8217;s favorite song</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> True.  It&#8217;s all a matter of perspective.  I love how he&#8217;s saying &#8220;how I roll.&#8221; I wish I had written this song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> So then you could&#8217;ve left out the lyrics that are going to date this song so badly?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> No, so I could just say &#8220;that&#8217;s how I roll&#8221; over and over.  That&#8217;s how I roll.  Hey, that was a great sudden ending.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Not a fake ending, either.  Two horn shrieks.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s good.  Like you said.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Well I like it better when it&#8217;s like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_(band)">Wire</a>.  And the song just ends 30 seconds in, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;What the hell? Okay.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Track Eight: &#8220;Breathing&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> See, here&#8217;s another slow one.  I think maybe they just had a million slow ones and not enough fast ones, and they were just thinking, <em>We have to get this up to 45 minutes</em>, so they decided to pad the album.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I&#8217;m gonna have nightmares about this meal-replacement bar.  It must be because there&#8217;s no sugar.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It says &#8220;New and Improved.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I&#8217;ll believe the &#8220;New.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Well, originally it was just a bar of dog shit, so they improved it from there.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Gross. I think that would have been preferable.  That&#8217;s how disgusting the bar was.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> So I think it&#8217;s saying something that we&#8217;ve been talking about your meal-replacement bar through this whole song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Background music.  This song is really sweeping.  It sounds like a <a href="http://www.adpunch.org/images/mariah-carey-pepsi-motorola-ringtone.jpg">Mariah Carey</a> ballad, but re-interpreted by an alt-pop-rock band.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> So, <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Basically.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> This is just uninspired.  Oh, wait, listen to this.  It&#8217;s like the breakdown.  Just bass and drums.  This is good.  You know, I really believe that this band makes excellent use of space &#8211; when they&#8217;re doing it.  But the problem is they&#8217;re not always doing it.  Like, listen, this is a great build.  And I understand it could be meant as contrastive, but I think it&#8217;s more like they just give in too often to having everyone play.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This build, this riff &#8211; it&#8217;s too good for the rest of the song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Listen to these power solos!</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> It&#8217;s like in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/"><em>Forrest Gump</em></a> when Robin Wright Penn is standing on the ledge, and &#8220;Freebird&#8221; just starts wailing.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Good outro, good outro!  Way to save a crappy song.</p>

<h3>Track Nine: &#8220;Pocket Full of Numbers&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Funky bass.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> This is the token funk genre track.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> The <a href="http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Justin_Timberfake">Timberfake</a> track.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I think we&#8217;ve been seeing this as a theme in a lot of the bands we review &#8211; the tendency to insert the genre track.  And it sounds like <a href="http://www.maroon5.com/">Maroon 5</a> here.  I feel like people have been doing this since at least the &rsquo;90s, the random funk or groove track.  And it&#8217;s never very good.  Would you like me to make you a mix CD of all the token genre tracks I can find on otherwise good rock albums?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Yes, and then we can put the playlist up on the site.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> And then I could melt it in the microwave and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lNfBZTz2xQ">post it on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This sounds like elevator music.  Safe, jazzy blues.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> If you took out the lyrics, it would sound like hold music.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> The bass line here sounds like <a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/realitybites/tempted.htm">&#8220;Tempted (by the Fruit of Another).&#8221;</a></p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I mean, these guys have kind of an &rsquo;80s fetish going on.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> That&#8217;s really hip right now.  Thanks, <a href="http://www.thekillersmusic.com/">The Killers</a>.  Synth, synth, I&#8217;m bored with you.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Stewart, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/graphics/2007/05/16/wtrump16.jpg">you&#8217;re fired</a>.</p>

<h3>Track 10: &#8220;New World&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I feel like I&#8217;m in a <a href="http://www.1980-games.com/us/old-games/java-games/mariobros.php">Mario Bros. game</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I like these arpeggiated riffs.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> No.  No.  There is nothing about this song that I like.  It&#8217;s just another funky jazz safe white blues song.  How long do you think their guitarist&#8217;s hair is?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Let&#8217;s check their <a href="http://www.54seconds.com/">website</a>.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Hey, these guys are a lot older than I thought they were.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Yeah, they are easily pushing their 70s.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> That&#8217;s not what I meant.  Screw you.  Why do you think they call themselves 54 Seconds?  I thought maybe it was an homage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54">Studio 54</a>, which they probably frequented, because have you seen <a href="http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/4481/old_peoples.jpg">how old they are</a>?</p>

<h3>Track 11: &#8220;Still Behind Me&#8221;</h3>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> We made it through.  This song is also taking me back to the eighth grade.  Well, a different time in the eighth grade.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Like, 54 seconds later?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I could picture myself crying alone in my living room to this song.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Eating a tub of rocky road?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I prefer Ben and Jerry&#8217;s <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/our_products/flavor_details.cfm?product_id=38">Everything but the&#8230;</a> ice cream.  Or <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/our_products/flavor_details.cfm?product_id=5">Cherry Garcia</a>.  Or they have this one that&#8217;s like <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/our_products/flavor_details.cfm?product_id=49">mint with chocolate</a> in it.  I like ice cream!</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Hey, Ben and Jerry&#8217;s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panderer">we&#8217;re plugging you</a>.  Send us gift certificates care of Adam and Nicole, <em>That Other Paper</em>, P.O. Box 66458. Austin, TX 78766.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This song makes me want to open my wrists.  But in a good way.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> And there&#8217;s the pull-quote.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> This is the way you end a CD, though.  For real.  Make them sad.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Or put them to sleep.  Do you seriously like this?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Yeah, I do!</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> It&#8217;s so contrived.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> Whatever, I like contrived things.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> For a CD that started out making good use of what it had to offer, I feel like this is a step down.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I&#8217;m gonna have to disagree in that I like depressing songs when they&#8217;re done right.  Hand me the knife &#8211; I&#8217;m ready.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I don&#8217;t know about this.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> There&#8217;s something to be said about CDs that end with a sad song.  They make you want to go back and listen to the beginning again.  See, I got this CD player for my tenth birthday, and I used to press the repeat button and listen to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jagged-Little-Pill-Alanis-Morissette/dp/B000002MY3"><em>Jagged Little Pill</em></a> over and over.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Sad is fine.  The only thing that makes me sad here is the fact that the band decided it was a good idea to add yet another soppy ballad.  Well, that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> [<em>pretending to wake up</em>] Oh &#8211; what?  Where are we?</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> I thought you liked it.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Nicole</strong> I did like it.  Now it&#8217;s going to play again, because I pressed the repeat button.</p>

<p><strong class="allcaps blue space">Adam</strong> Turn it off!</p>

<p><strong>Closing thoughts:</strong> This isn&#8217;t a bad album by any means, and if you like <em>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</em>, chances are you&#8217;ll love everything on here.  For us, some of the slow tracks didn&#8217;t pass muster until they were almost over.  But we agreed that when the band is on its game, the music and production are both excellent and worth repeat listens.  You&#8217;ll want to come back to the fun ones like &#8220;I Wish I was a Girl&#8221; and &#8220;How I Roll,&#8221; or the interesting ones like &#8220;Ben&#8217;s Letter,&#8221; quite a few times.  Just watch out for the duds, which are less interesting than Nicole&#8217;s meal replacement bar.</p>

<p><strong>Final Rating:</strong> Atkins-approved.</p>

<p>Adam and Nicole may have consumed too much chalk, but they&#8217;re still looking for more music to review.  If you are a band or music promoter, you can send CDs to P.O. Box 66458, Austin, TX 78766 (c/o Adam Avramescu).</p>
