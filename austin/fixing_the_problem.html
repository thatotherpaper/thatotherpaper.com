<div class="caption">Dogs outside the Headquarters. The one on the right was dropped off to be neutered weeks ago. The owner never returned to pick him up.&nbsp;</div>
</div>


<div class="blurb">Austin is littered with too many cats and dogs, and local nonprofit Emancipet works tirelessly toward a solution â€” despite a broken-down mobile clinic.</div>


<p>When I pull into the parking lot of the Rosewood-Zaragosa Neighborhood Center in East Austin, still groggy (it&#8217;s 6:50am), a 60-something-year-old woman in yellow walks up to my car and taps on the glass before I can turn off the engine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a dog? There a dog in there?&#8221; she peers into my empty backseat, squinting, as I open the door. &#8220;What&#8217;s your dog? Male or female?&#8221;</p>

<p>When I open my mouth, she shoves a white notepad in front of my face. &#8220;We&#8217;re signing up to know who got here first.&#8221;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t blame her for imposing the notepad on all who pull into the lot. Today is one of Emancipet&#8217;s free spay-neuter days, and there are only 40 slots available for dogs and cats. Pet owners get here as early as 5am &#8211; the van doesn&#8217;t even show up until 7am.</p>

<p>I tell her that I&#8217;m just here to write a story. She looks at me like I&#8217;ve got some tricks up my sleeve &#8211; or perhaps a trunk full of puppies &#8211; before she puts the pad away.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do good things, these folks. &rsquo;Cause the police always be askin&#8217; for fuckin&#8217; papers on fuckin&#8217; shots, and I just can&#8217;t fuckin&#8217; deal.&#8221; Lighting a cigarette, she tells me about the blood-sucking fleas that keep killing her cats. She walks back to her Ford Ranger across the parking lot to keep watch.</p>

<div class="break">* * *</div>


<p>Del just arrived. He&#8217;s volunteered for Emancipet for over three years, helping out with the kind of stuff that the doctors and other staff otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have the time to do.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s friendly and patient as he tells the pet owners gathered around him that the Emancipet van, once again, wouldn&#8217;t start this morning. If we still want to receive free services, he says, we&#8217;ll need to drive about five miles to the Emancipet World Headquarters off of Airport Boulevard. We get in our cars and leave without complaining, though a few people are visibly frustrated.</p>

<p>When I pull up to the Headquarters, located in an old school building, people wait on the lawn with dogs on leashes and cats cowering in carriers. Dogs chase each other in a fenced-in area adjacent to the building.</p>

<p>The woman in yellow is, of course, already here, but now she&#8217;s resting, smoking another cigarette on the seat of a shiny black rolling walker. She&#8217;s still very concerned with the order in which the pets will be seen. &#8220;What number did ya get?&#8221; she yells to a woman with a cat. The woman doesn&#8217;t answer.</p>

<div class="image floatleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="../files/emancipet_hq.jpg" alt="emancipet_hq.jpg"/>
<div class="caption">The Emancipet World Headquarters, where on a typical day, veterinarians perform between 50 and 60 surgeries&nbsp;</div>
</div>


<p>Today is considered a slow day at Emancipet. There&#8217;s a couple &#8211; they look to be in their mid-twenties &#8211; standing around with two cat carriers. They aren&#8217;t talking; they stand with their arms crossed, occasionally kneeling to peer into the carriers. A few feet away from them is an older woman with brown hair and what looks like an APD badge and keys on a lanyard around her neck. She sways as she leans on a silver cane that&#8217;s beginning to dig into the dry ground. A tired-looking mom with a baby and a dog lean against a red SUV, while a woman in an oversized striped polo holds a cat carrier next to a woman with a small dog.</p>

<p>Every few minutes, one of the veterinarians comes outside, calls a number, and walks over to the corresponding person to ask them a few questions on a clipboard before taking their pet inside the clinic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What number did she call?&#8221; the woman in yellow asks.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t aim the question at a specific person, but the woman in the oversized polo responds, &#8220;She didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m six. I&#8217;m next,&#8221; says the baby-toting mom without making eye contact. &#8220;You&#8217;re seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman in yellow sits back down in her rolling walker and lights up again after commenting on the cool weather. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be sittin&#8217; here today if it was hot.&#8221; Some of us nod in agreement. The woman with the cane begins to talk about her Siamese cat&#8217;s odd sleeping habits, even though I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;m the only one listening.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s the woman in the oversized polo&#8217;s turn: Her cat has worms and needs to be spayed, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t give them medicine for worms on the same day as surgery,&#8221; the vet explains. The woman quietly argues with her &#8211; she doesn&#8217;t want to come back another day, because it&#8217;s too hard to get time off from work. The vet is so patient. So nice. So understanding. She explains this policy another three times, and the woman is nearly in tears. Finally, she stops arguing and decides to just get the medicine today.</p>

<p>All the numbers have been called, so everyone&#8217;s gone. They&#8217;ll have to come back to pick up their pets this afternoon between 4:45pm and 5:30pm.</p>

<p>I find Del inside the Headquarters, and he leads me back outside to tour the mobile clinic, which is being looked at by a repairman.</p>

<p>The mobile clinic is just what it sounds like &#8211; a tiny, cramped version of the main clinic on wheels. There are two surgery tables in the back; cages along the walls can hold 40 animals, sometimes up to 50. There&#8217;s so little space that it&#8217;s hard to imagine a team of veterinarians working in here while they listen to dogs bark and growl and cats hiss and meow. I&#8217;m not even comfortable standing in here with one person.</p>

<p>&#8220;They work for about 12 hours straight sometimes,&#8221; Del tells me.</p>

<p>The operating cost of the van is $1200 per day, and it&#8217;s used five days a week for 50 weeks out of the year to bring free services not just to East Austin neighborhoods, but to places like Bastrop and Marble Falls. After six years of this, it&#8217;s obvious why the van didn&#8217;t start this morning. And why the air conditioner is broken.</p>

<p>How much for a new mobile clinic? $200,000.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d initially planned to spend the day with the Emancipet vets, watching them perform surgeries and assisting them in any way I could. But once Del took me back to the surgery suite where two of the vets were getting ready to start operating on the animals, it was clear that I&#8217;d be more help if I stayed out of the way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only 8:45am, but the doctors have to perform surgery on about 35 animals over the next eight hours. Thirty-five surgeries in eight hours might sound like a lot, but really it&#8217;s nothing to these doctors &#8211; they keep emphasizing that today is a slow day. On a typical day, they perform between 50 and 60 surgeries.</p>

<p>The vets are stressed beyond belief, and they haven&#8217;t even begun to operate. In just a few minutes, the first animal will be brought out, sedated, and spayed, and then the next animal will be brought out. And then the next.</p>

<p>You can imagine how much money is required to keep Emancipet going. Luckily, they recently received a $108,000 grant from Impact Austin. With this money, they were finally able to purchase a microscope. The rest of the money is being used to set up an additional surgery suite. Before, they only had two suites &#8211; that was barely enough to handle 60 surgeries a day.</p>

<div class="image floatright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="../files/emancipet_van.jpg" alt="emancipet_van.jpg"/>
<div class="caption">Emancipet is in desperate need of a new van&nbsp;</div>
</div>


<p>Still, there&#8217;s the issue of the $200,000 needed to buy a new van.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s everything else: cleaning supplies, towels, washcloths, food, washers, and dryers&#8230; Note that &#8220;washers&#8221; and &#8220;dryers&#8221; are plural. Since Emancipet uses cloth instead of paper towels to recycle as much as they can, this requires multiple washers and dryers to run all day long. The workload put on the units &#8211; these aren&#8217;t commercial grade machines &#8211; ends up breaking them after only a few months of use.</p>

<div class="break">* * *</div>


<p>Fifty to sixty spays and neuters a day may sound like a lot, but it&#8217;s not even putting a dent in Austin&#8217;s animal population. For every human baby born, there are seven very homeless cats and dogs. This number adds up fast, and Town Lake Animal Shelter has to deal with 24,000 unwanted animals per year, 13,000 of which are put down at the shelter. This costs Austin a ridiculous amount of money, not just from the cost of caring for animals at the shelter, but also from the cost of taking 1,000 pounds of dead animal carcasses to the landfill every day.</p>

<p>The answer to the problem seems simple enough: Just have everybody spay or neuter their pets &#8211; right?</p>

<p>Implementing a spay-neuter ordinance is what many places around the country have done to control the stray pet population and reduce euthanasia rates in shelters. Some of those places are: King County, Washington; San Mateo County, California; and Buncombe County, North Carolina. According to Emancipet, shelters in these areas have reduced euthanasia rates by up to 70%.</p>

<p>Though spay-neuter ordinances have made a significant difference in these areas, getting them implemented in other cities can be tough. The biggest opponents to it are animal breeders and owners of purebred and show animals, who may not realize the ordinance would exclude their animals so long as they paid an unaltered pet registration fee of $100 every year. Service dogs and animals used by police would also be excluded from the ordinance.</p>

<p>In April of this year, Los Angeles County approved a spay-neuter ordinance that will require all dogs older than four months in the county to be spayed or neutered and implanted with an identifying microchip. Even though shelters in LA County spayed and neutered animals before placing them with new owners, it wasn&#8217;t enough &#8211; there was still a constant stream of animals coming into the shelters that weren&#8217;t spayed or neutered. The fact that over 19,000 dogs had to be euthanized in 2004-2005, plus worry over the behavior and danger of stray dogs, led to the LA County Board of Supervisors&#8217; unanimous approval of the ordinance.</p>

<p>The concern about stray animals shouldn&#8217;t be any different in other cities, especially Austin. Last year, 16,297 incidents of severe bites from dogs and cats were responded to by police. In 80% of these cases, the animal is unaltered (spayed and neutered animals tend to be less aggressive and less likely to roam). Oh, and each one of these incidents cost the city &#8211; as well as me, you, and your responsible, tax-paying pals &#8211; $61.35. Multiply that by 16,297, and you get $999,820.95.</p>

<p>Or five new mobile clinics.</p>

So what about people who want to help Emancipet, but can&#8217;t afford to make a donation? <strong>&#8220;Volunteer,&#8221;</strong> Del urges. &#8220;Coming here even to just do one load of laundry would be such a huge help. <strong>We need help.</strong> I don&#8217;t know what else to say.&#8221;

<p>I have a comment about Ferrell kitties.</p>
<p>About 5 months ago we had a young, starving, pitiful stray kitty adopt us. She looked to be about 6 months old, was very wild and it took a good amount of time to get her to use to having a home and a family. She had no concept of playing with people or being in a house with other animals. She has come a long way since then and we have really gotten attached. We took her to the vet for an examination and vaccinations. At the time, we discussed getting her spayed before too much time passed. Last week we took her in for the surgery. Once the vet cut her open, they realized she had already been fixed. The poor kitty had to go through all of that pain for nothing. We are thinking at this point she may have been part of the Ferrell cat sterilization program. Why couldnâ€™t there be co-ordination amoung organizations in charge of this wonderful program to add a tag of some sort like small tattoo on the kittyâ€™s ear to indicate that this procedure has been performed?</p>
