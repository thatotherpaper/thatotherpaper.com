      <p>I desperately wanted a class ring.  It was my senior year of high school, and even though I hated high school, I wanted something concrete to commemorate the last four years. Plus, class rings were shiny and pretty.  I begged and begged my parents to buy me one, but it was just too expensive &#8211; $300 for a ring that I would wear for six months, put in a box with all my old photos of people I don&#8217;t talk to anymore, and pull out every year or so for the rest of my life. We weren&#8217;t poor by any means; my parents would just have rather spent that money on something else, like a car payment. I really couldn&#8217;t blame them for that, but when you&#8217;re in high school, your parents&#8217; car payments seem much less pressing than your need for a shiny piece of jewelry.</p>

</div>


<p>Weeks later, they buckled, and I ordered my ring.  (I tried to keep it cheap.  After all, my parents did have a car payment to make.)  My ring was beautiful &#8211; steel with a translucent light green stone, my name inscribed on the inside.  I wore it so much that my skin almost <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23595533/">grew around it</a>.</p>

<p>One day I was in the restroom at Grapevine Mills mall and I needed to wash my hands.  I took off my ring, set it on the little platform above the sink, washed my hands, and left. Ten minutes later, I absentmindedly fumbled for my ring and realized it wasn&#8217;t on my finger.  I rushed back to the restroom to find it. It was gone, and I was distraught, not just for the loss of my ring, but also for the thought of what my parents would do to me when they found out I&#8217;d lost a $300 present.</p>



<p>Fast forward a few weeks. I had finally come to terms with the fact that I&#8217;d lost a beloved piece of jewelry (and lost my parents $300) when a hand-addressed package arrived in the mail for me. Who would be sending me a package?  I ripped it open to find, to my infinite surprise, my ring.  There was a letter, too.  It read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Christine,</p>

<p>I found your ring above the sink in the restroom in the food court at Grapevine Mills. I called your high school and got your address so I could mail it back to you. I know I would have wanted someone to do the same for me.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Joan Smith</p></blockquote>

<p>I just stared at the letter.  I couldn&#8217;t believe that someone had gone so far out of their way to return something that some stupid high school girl was careless enough to lose in a mall restroom.  But Joan Smith had done it for me.  Because of her kindness, my ring was back on my finger and I was back in my parents&#8217; good graces.</p>

<p>So I sent Joan Smith a $25 gift certificate to Blockbuster &#8211; that was something I could afford and be fairly sure a perfect stranger would enjoy.  But $25 could not convey how grateful I was to the woman who found my ring.  To my angsty teenage soul, Joan Smith&#8217;s selfless act was proof that good did exist in the world.  </p>

<p>One evening at a dinner party, I told this story to some friends, marveling at how I of all people had benefited from such a rare act of kindness.  To my surprise, every single one of my friends had a similar story about losing something and someone going to great lengths to return it to them. </p>

<p>Like me, my friend Blair also lost a beloved piece of jewelry, a one-of-a-kind cross necklace that her parents had brought her from Spain. One summer at Christian camp, she was playing touch football when she looked down and realized the cross wasn&#8217;t there. All of her friends combed the field for hours but no one could find it hidden in the blades of grass. Finally, Blair gave it up for lost, but drew a picture of it for the front office just in case someone ran across it in the future. Six months later, she got a letter from the camp leader saying that someone had stepped on it on the field a few weeks ago and turned it in. Because of the picture that Blair left, the camp leader knew it was hers and sent it back to her.</p>

<p>Brandan lost something a little less special. Stuck at the airport with a very long plane ride to look forward to, she bought a trashy romance novel in the airport store, thinking she&#8217;d read something fun and brainless to entertain her until she landed. Unfortunately, says Brandan, &#8220;It was the worst book I have ever read. It was depressing and sad and I was expecting something trashy and fun.&#8221; Disgusted, she stuck the book, with her ticket stub as a bookmark, in the back of the seat in front of her and forgot it. She got it in the mail about a week later. The woman sitting next to her saw that she&#8217;d forgotten it, got Brandan&#8217;s address off her ticket stub, and sent it back to her. Brandan, unlike Blair and me, was not happy to see the book.  There was a reason she had so easily forgotten it.  &#8220;I still keep it despite the fact that I have never finished it because it was so bad because I feel I owe it to the person who made such an effort to get in back to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But my favorite story has to be Chelsey&#8217;s. Chelsey is a friend of a friend, and I heard this story second-hand before asking her to tell it to me herself. About two years ago, her uncle got into a motorcycle accident and went into a coma. The family lived in Arkansas, so she had a long, painful plane ride ahead of her.  She knew she wouldn&#8217;t be able to concentrate on anything, so, on a whim, she grabbed a blank Moleskine journal her dad had bought her a year before. What the heck, she figured. Maybe I can draw in it or something.</p>

<p>She wrote in that notebook the entire length of the flight. As journals often do, it became her constant companion. So, naturally, she lost it.  Her hopes of getting it back were slim to none – instead of writing her name in the front cover, she&#8217;d written &#8220;Read everything.&#8221; She desperately posted flyers for her journal around West Campus &#8211; she even offered a monetary award.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, she got a message from a random guy on Facebook. &#8220;I found your journal on the street,&#8221; the message said. &#8220;It seemed really important, so I tried really hard to find you.&#8221; How exactly did he figure out who the journal belonged to when it didn&#8217;t have her name in it? By reading the whole thing cover-to-cover, finding out who her friends were, connecting names, and running Facebook searches.  This random guy knew more about Chelsey than even her closest friends did.</p>

<p>They arranged to meet so he could give her back her journal.  Chelsey offered him the monetary award she had advertised, but all he wanted was a pack of gum. He then friended her on Facebook, and they never spoke again.</p>
